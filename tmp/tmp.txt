##########END##########
Individualised care
##########END##########
Such an approach is especially important in the context of multimorbidity.
##########END##########
Patient education
##########END##########
It is evidence-based, and suits the needs of the person.
##########END##########
It has a structured curriculum that is theory-driven, evidence-based and resource-effective, has supporting materials, and is written down.
##########END##########
It is delivered by trained educators who have an understanding of educational theory appropriate to the age and needs of the person, and who are trained and competent to deliver the principles and content of the programme.
##########END##########
The outcomes are audited regularly.
##########END##########
Offer group education programmes as the preferred option
##########END##########
Ensure that the patient-education programmes available meet the cultural, linguistic, cognitive and literacy needs within the local area.

Dietary advice and bariatric surgery
##########END##########
Integrate dietary advice with a personalised diabetes management plan, including other aspects of lifestyle modification, such as increasing physical activity and losing weight.
##########END##########
Remember that lesser degrees of weight loss may still be of benefit, and that larger degrees of weight loss in the longer term will have advantageous metabolic impact.
##########END##########
Discourage the use of foods marketed specifically for people with diabetes.

For a person with continuing intolerance to an ACE inhibitor (other than renal deterioration or hyperkalaemia), substitute an angiotensin II-receptor antagonist for the ACE inhibitor.
