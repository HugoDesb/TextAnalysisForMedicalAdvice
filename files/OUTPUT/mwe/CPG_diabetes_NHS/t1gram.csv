For treating vomiting caused by gastroparesis in adults with type 2 diabetes: consider alternating use of erythomycin12 and metoclopramide13 consider domperidone11 only in exceptional circumstances (if domperidone is the only effective treatment) and in accordance with MHRA guidance.	For guidance on managing painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy in adults with type 2 diabetes, see the NICE guideline on neuropathic pain in adults.	Think about the possibility of contributory sympathetic nervous system damage for adults with type 2 diabetes who lose the warning signs of hypoglycaemia.	Think about the possibility of autonomic neuropathy affecting the gut in adults with type 2 diabetes who have unexplained diarrhoea that happens particularly at night.	When using tricyclic drugs and antihypertensive drug treatments in adults with type 2 diabetes who have autonomic neuropathy, be aware of the increased likelihood of side effects such as orthostatic hypotension.	Investigate the possibility of autonomic neuropathy affecting the bladder in adults with type 2 diabetes who have unexplained bladder-emptying problems.

Following discussion, refer men with type 2 diabetes to a service offering other medical, surgical or psychological management of erectile dysfunction if treatment (including a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor, as appropriate) has been unsuccessful.

Explain the reasons for, and success of, eye screening systems to adults with type 2 diabetes, so that attendance is not reduced by lack of knowledge or fear of outcome.	
diabetes	1	-0.7186	39	Adopt an individualised approach to diabetes care that is tailored to the needs and circumstances of adults with type 2 diabetes, taking into account their personal preferences, comorbidities, risks from polypharmacy, and their ability to benefit from long-term interventions because of reduced life expectancy.	Take into account any disabilities, including visual impairment, when planning and delivering care for adults with type 2 diabetes.	Offer structured education to adults with type 2 diabetes and or their family members or carers (as appropriate) at and around the time of diagnosis, with annual reinforcement and review.	Explain to people and their carers that structured education is an integral part of diabetes care.	Ensure that any structured education programme for adults with type 2 diabetes includes the following components: It is evidence-based, and suits the needs of the person. It has specific aims and learning objectives, and supports the person and their family members and carers in developing attitudes, beliefs, knowledge and skills to self-manage diabetes. It has a structured curriculum that is theory-driven, evidence-based and resource-effective, has supporting materials, and is written down. It is delivered by trained educators who have an understanding of educational theory appropriate to the age and needs of the person, and who are trained and competent to deliver the principles and content of the programme. It is quality assured, and reviewed by trained, competent, independent assessors who measure it against criteria that ensure consistency. The outcomes are audited regularly.	Ensure that all members of the diabetes healthcare team are familiar with the patient-education programmes available locally, that these programmes are integrated with the rest of the care pathway, and that adults with type 2 diabetes and their family members or carers (as appropriate) have the opportunity to contribute to the design and provision of local programmes.	Emphasise advice on healthy balanced eating that is applicable to the general population when providing advice to adults with type 2 diabetes.	Integrate dietary advice with a personalised diabetes management plan, including other aspects of lifestyle modification, such as increasing physical activity and losing weight.	For adults with type 2 diabetes who are overweight, set an initial body weight loss target of 5â€“10percent.	Advise adults with type 2 diabetes that limited substitution of sucrose-containing foods for other carbohydrate in the meal plan is allowable, but that they should take care to avoid excess energy intake.	Discourage the use of foods marketed specifically for people with diabetes.	When adults with type 2 diabetes are admitted to hospital as inpatients or to any other care setting, implement a meal planning system that provides consistency in the carbohydrate content of meals and snacks.	Measure blood pressure at least annually in an adult with type 2 diabetes without previously diagnosed hypertension or renal disease.	For an adult with type 2 diabetes on antihypertensive drug treatment when diabetes is diagnosed, review blood pressure control and medications used.	Do not offer antiplatelet therapy (aspirin or clopidogrel) for adults with type 2 diabetes without cardiovascular disease.	Seek advice from a team with specialist expertise in diabetes or clinical biochemistry.	Involve adults with type 2 diabetes in decisions about their individual HbA1c target.	For adults with type 2 diabetes managed either by lifestyle and diet, or by lifestyle and diet combined with a single drug not associated with hypoglycaemia, support the person to aim for an HbA1c level of 48 mmol mol(6.5percent).	In adults with type 2 diabetes, if HbA1c levels are not adequately controlled by a single drug and rise to 58 mmol mol (7.5percent) or higher: reinforce advice about diet, lifestyle and adherence to drug treatment and support the person to aim for an HbA1c level of 53 mmol mol (7.0percent) and intensify drug treatment.	If adults with type 2 diabetes achieve an HbA1c level that is lower than their target and they are not experiencing hypoglycaemia, encourage them to maintain it.	If adults with type 2 diabetes achieve an HbA1c level that is lower than their target and they are not experiencing hypoglycaemia, encourage them to maintain it.	Do not routinely offer self-monitoring of blood glucose levels for adults with type 2 diabetes unless: the person is on insulin or there is evidence of hypoglycaemic episodes or the person is on oral medication that may increase their risk of hypoglycaemia while driving or operating machinery or the person is pregnant, or is planning to become pregnant.	Consider short-term self-monitoring of blood glucose levels in adults with type 2 diabetes (and review treatment as necessary): when starting treatment with oral or intravenous corticosteroids or to confirm suspected hypoglycaemia.	Think about a diagnosis of gastroparesis in adults with type 2 diabetes with erratic blood glucose control or unexplained gastric bloating or vomiting, taking into account possible alternative diagnoses.	For adults with type 2 diabetes who have vomiting caused by gastroparesis, explain that: there is not strong evidence that any available antiemetic therapy is effective some people have had benefit with domperidone11, erythromycin12 or metoclopramide13.	For treating vomiting caused by gastroparesis in adults with type 2 diabetes: consider alternating use of erythomycin12 and metoclopramide13 consider domperidone11 only in exceptional circumstances (if domperidone is the only effective treatment) and in accordance with MHRA guidance.
