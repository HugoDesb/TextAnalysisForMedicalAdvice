low hba1c level	0	1.6	2	Be aware that there are other possible reasons for a low HbA1c level, for example, deteriorating renal function or sudden weight loss.	Be aware that there are other possible reasons for a low HbA1c level, for example, deteriorating renal function or sudden weight loss.	
sudden weight loss	0	1.6	2	Be aware that there are other possible reasons for a low HbA1c level, for example, deteriorating renal function or sudden weight loss.	Be aware that there are other possible reasons for a low HbA1c level, for example, deteriorating renal function or sudden weight loss.	
blood glucose levels	0	1.4296	2	Do not routinely offer self-monitoring of blood glucose levels for adults with type 2 diabetes unless: the person is on insulin or there is evidence of hypoglycaemic episodes or the person is on oral medication that may increase their risk of hypoglycaemia while driving or operating machinery or the person is pregnant, or is planning to become pregnant.	Consider short-term self-monitoring of blood glucose levels in adults with type 2 diabetes (and review treatment as necessary): when starting treatment with oral or intravenous corticosteroids or to confirm suspected hypoglycaemia.	
caribbean family origin	0	1.4296	2	Exceptions to this are people of African or Caribbean family origin, or women for whom there is a possibility of becoming pregnant.	The first-line antihypertensive drug treatment for a person of African or Caribbean family origin should be an ACE inhibitor plus either a diuretic or a generic calcium-channel blocker.	
problematic erectile dysfunction	0	1.4296	2	Assess, educate and support men with type 2 diabetes who have problematic erectile dysfunction, addressing contributory factors such as cardiovascular disease as well as possible treatment options.	Consider a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor to treat problematic erectile dysfunction in men with type 2 diabetes, initially choosing the drug with the lowest acquisition cost and taking into account any contraindications.	
angiotensin ii-receptor antagonist	0	1.2985	3	For a person with continuing intolerance to an ACE inhibitor (other than renal deterioration or hyperkalaemia), substitute an angiotensin II-receptor antagonist for the ACE inhibitor.	Do not combine an ACE inhibitor with an angiotensin II-receptor antagonist to treat hypertension.	If the person's blood pressure is not reduced to the individually agreed target with triple therapy, add an alpha-blocker, a beta-blocker or a potassium-sparing diuretic (the last with caution if the person is already taking an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin II-receptor antagonist).	
first-line antihypertensive drug	0	1.2985	3	First-line antihypertensive drug treatment should be a once-daily, generic angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor.	The first-line antihypertensive drug treatment for a person of African or Caribbean family origin should be an ACE inhibitor plus either a diuretic or a generic calcium-channel blocker.	A calcium-channel blocker should be the first-line antihypertensive drug treatment for a woman for whom, after an informed discussion, it is agreed there is a possibility of her becoming pregnant	
antihypertensive drug treatment	0	1.0783	7	For an adult with type 2 diabetes on antihypertensive drug treatment when diabetes is diagnosed, review blood pressure control and medications used.	Monitor blood pressure every 1–2 months, and intensify therapy if the person is already on antihypertensive drug treatment, until the blood pressure is consistently below 140 80 mmHg (below 130 80 mmHg if there is kidney, eye or cerebrovascular damage).	First-line antihypertensive drug treatment should be a once-daily, generic angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor.	The first-line antihypertensive drug treatment for a person of African or Caribbean family origin should be an ACE inhibitor plus either a diuretic or a generic calcium-channel blocker.	A calcium-channel blocker should be the first-line antihypertensive drug treatment for a woman for whom, after an informed discussion, it is agreed there is a possibility of her becoming pregnant	Check for possible adverse effects of antihypertensive drug treatment – including the risks from unnecessarily low blood pressure.	When using tricyclic drugs and antihypertensive drug treatments in adults with type 2 diabetes who have autonomic neuropathy, be aware of the increased likelihood of side effects such as orthostatic hypotension.	
cotton wool spots	0	0.0	1	Refer to an ophthalmologist in accordance with the National Screening Committee criteria and timelines if any of these features are present: referable maculopathy: exudate or retinal thickening within 1 disc diameter of the centre of the fovea circinate or group of exudates within the macula (the macula is defined here as a circle centred on the fovea, with a diameter the distance between the temporal border of the optic disc and the fovea) any microaneurysm or haemorrhage within 1 disc diameter of the centre of the fovea, only if associated with deterioration of best visual acuity to 6 12 or worse. referable pre-proliferative retinopathy (if cotton wool spots are present, look carefully for the following features, but cotton wool spots themselves do not define pre-proliferative retinopathy): any venous beading any venous reduplication any intraretinal microvascular abnormalities multiple deep, round or blot haemorrhages. any large, sudden unexplained drop in visual acuity.
