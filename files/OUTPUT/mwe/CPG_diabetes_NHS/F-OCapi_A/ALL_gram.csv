screening	1	0.9627	7	On diagnosis, GPs should immediately refer adults with type 2 diabetes to the local eye screening service.

Perform visual acuity testing as a routine part of eye screening programmes.	Depending on the findings, follow structured eye screening by: routine review in 1 year or earlier review or referral to an ophthalmologist.	Refer to an ophthalmologist in accordance with the National Screening Committee criteria and timelines if any of these features are present: referable maculopathy: exudate or retinal thickening within 1 disc diameter of the centre of the fovea circinate or group of exudates within the macula (the macula is defined here as a circle centred on the fovea, with a diameter the distance between the temporal border of the optic disc and the fovea) any microaneurysm or haemorrhage within 1 disc diameter of the centre of the fovea, only if associated with deterioration of best visual acuity to 6 12 or worse. referable pre-proliferative retinopathy (if cotton wool spots are present, look carefully for the following features, but cotton wool spots themselves do not define pre-proliferative retinopathy): any venous beading any venous reduplication any intraretinal microvascular abnormalities multiple deep, round or blot haemorrhages. any large, sudden unexplained drop in visual acuity.

Add medications if lifestyle advice does not reduce blood pressure to below 140 80 mmHg (below 130 80 mmHg if there is kidney, eye or cerebrovascular damage).	Monitor blood pressure every 1–2 months, and intensify therapy if the person is already on antihypertensive drug treatment, until the blood pressure is consistently below 140 80 mmHg (below 130 80 mmHg if there is kidney, eye or cerebrovascular damage).	If the person's blood pressure is not reduced to the individually agreed target with first-line therapy, add a calcium-channel blocker or a diuretic (usually a thiazide or thiazide-related diuretic).	If the person's blood pressure is not reduced to the individually agreed target with triple therapy, add an alpha-blocker, a beta-blocker or a potassium-sparing diuretic (the last with caution if the person is already taking an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin II-receptor antagonist).	Monitor the blood pressure of a person who has attained and consistently remained at his or her blood pressure target every 4–6 months.	Check for possible adverse effects of antihypertensive drug treatment – including the risks from unnecessarily low blood pressure.	Do not routinely offer self-monitoring of blood glucose levels for adults with type 2 diabetes unless: the person is on insulin or there is evidence of hypoglycaemic episodes or the person is on oral medication that may increase their risk of hypoglycaemia while driving or operating machinery or the person is pregnant, or is planning to become pregnant.

Offer group education programmes as the preferred option. Provide an alternative of equal standard for a person unable or unwilling to participate in group education.	Provide dietary advice in a form sensitive to the person's needs, culture and beliefs, being sensitive to their willingness to change and the effects on their quality of life.	Integrate dietary advice with a personalised diabetes management plan, including other aspects of lifestyle modification, such as increasing physical activity and losing weight.	Reducing the risk of hypoglycaemia should be a particular aim for a person using insulin or an insulin secretagogue.	Monitor blood pressure every 1–2 months, and intensify therapy if the person is already on antihypertensive drug treatment, until the blood pressure is consistently below 140 80 mmHg (below 130 80 mmHg if there is kidney, eye or cerebrovascular damage).	The first-line antihypertensive drug treatment for a person of African or Caribbean family origin should be an ACE inhibitor plus either a diuretic or a generic calcium-channel blocker.	For a person with continuing intolerance to an ACE inhibitor (other than renal deterioration or hyperkalaemia), substitute an angiotensin II-receptor antagonist for the ACE inhibitor.	If the person's blood pressure is not reduced to the individually agreed target with first-line therapy, add a calcium-channel blocker or a diuretic (usually a thiazide or thiazide-related diuretic).	If the person's blood pressure is not reduced to the individually agreed target with triple therapy, add an alpha-blocker, a beta-blocker or a potassium-sparing diuretic (the last with caution if the person is already taking an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin II-receptor antagonist).	Monitor the blood pressure of a person who has attained and consistently remained at his or her blood pressure target every 4–6 months.	For adults with type 2 diabetes managed either by lifestyle and diet, or by lifestyle and diet combined with a single drug not associated with hypoglycaemia, support the person to aim for an HbA1c level of 48 mmol mol(6.5percent).	For adults on a drug associated with hypoglycaemia, support the person to aim for an HbA1c level of 53 mmol mol (7.0percent).	In adults with type 2 diabetes, if HbA1c levels are not adequately controlled by a single drug and rise to 58 mmol mol (7.5percent) or higher: reinforce advice about diet, lifestyle and adherence to drug treatment and support the person to aim for an HbA1c level of 53 mmol mol (7.0percent) and intensify drug treatment.	Do not routinely offer self-monitoring of blood glucose levels for adults with type 2 diabetes unless: the person is on insulin or there is evidence of hypoglycaemic episodes or the person is on oral medication that may increase their risk of hypoglycaemia while driving or operating machinery or the person is pregnant, or is planning to become pregnant.

It has a structured curriculum that is theory-driven, evidence-based and resource-effective, has supporting materials, and is written down. It is delivered by trained educators who have an understanding of educational theory appropriate to the age and needs of the person, and who are trained and competent to deliver the principles and content of the programme.
