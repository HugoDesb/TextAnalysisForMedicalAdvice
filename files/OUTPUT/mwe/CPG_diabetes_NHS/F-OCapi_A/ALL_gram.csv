Consider, as an alternative to NPH insulin, using insulin detemir or insulin glargine if:the person needs assistance from a carer or healthcare professional to inject insulin, and use of insulin detemir or insulin glargine would reduce the frequency of injections from twice to once daily or the person's lifestyle is restricted by recurrent symptomatic hypoglycaemic episodes or the person would otherwise need twice-daily NPH insulin injections in combination with oral glucose-lowering drugs..

For moreinformation about supporting adherence, see the NICE guideline on medicines adherence. 1.6.7 For adults with type 2 diabetes managed either by lifestyle and diet, or by lifestyle and diet combined with a single drug not associated with hypoglycaemia, support the person to aim for an HbA1c level of 48 mmol mol (6.5percent).	For adults on a drug associated with hypoglycaemia, support the personto aim for an HbA1c level of 53 mmol mol (7.0percent). 1.6.8 In adults with type 2 diabetes, if HbA1c levels are not adequately controlled by a single drug and rise to 58 mmol mol (7.5percent) or higher: reinforce advice about diet, lifestyle and adherence to drug treatment and support the person to aim for an HbA1c level of 53 mmol mol (7.0percent) and intensify drug treatment. 1.6.9 Consider relaxing the target HbA1c level (see recommendations 1.6.7 and 1.6.8).
