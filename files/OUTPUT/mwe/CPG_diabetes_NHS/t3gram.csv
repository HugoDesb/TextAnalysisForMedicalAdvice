tight blood glucose	0	-0.11469999999999991	1	Last updated May 2017 on a case-by-case basis, with particular consideration for people who are older or frail, for adults with type 2 diabetes: who are unlikely to achieve longer-term risk-reduction benefits, for example, people with a reduced life expectancy for whom tight blood glucose control poses a high risk of the consequences of hypoglycaemia, for example, people who are at risk of falling, people who have impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia, and people who drive or operate machinery as part of their job for whom intensive management would not be appropriate, for example, people with significant comorbidities.	
basal insulin regimen	0	-0.4006	1	Monitor adults with type 2 diabetes who are on a basal insulin regimen (NPH insulin, insulin detemir or insulin glargine ) for the need for short-acting insulin before meals (or a pre-mixed biphasic insulin preparation).	
biphasic insulin preparation	0	-0.4006	1	Monitor adults with type 2 diabetes who are on a basal insulin regimen (NPH insulin, insulin detemir or insulin glargine ) for the need for short-acting insulin before meals (or a pre-mixed biphasic insulin preparation).	
pre-mixed biphasic insulin	0	-0.4006	1	Monitor adults with type 2 diabetes who are on a basal insulin regimen (NPH insulin, insulin detemir or insulin glargine ) for the need for short-acting insulin before meals (or a pre-mixed biphasic insulin preparation).	
nph insulin injections	0	-0.4122	1	Consider, as an alternative to NPH insulin, using insulin detemir or insulin glargine if: the person needs assistance from a carer or healthcare professional to inject insulin, and use of insulin detemir or insulin glargine would reduce the frequency of injections from twice to once daily or the person's lifestyle is restricted by recurrent symptomatic hypoglycaemic episodes or the person would otherwise need twice-daily NPH insulin injections in combination with oral glucose-lowering drugs.	
oral glucose-lowering drugs	0	-0.4122	1	Consider, as an alternative to NPH insulin, using insulin detemir or insulin glargine if: the person needs assistance from a carer or healthcare professional to inject insulin, and use of insulin detemir or insulin glargine would reduce the frequency of injections from twice to once daily or the person's lifestyle is restricted by recurrent symptomatic hypoglycaemic episodes or the person would otherwise need twice-daily NPH insulin injections in combination with oral glucose-lowering drugs.
