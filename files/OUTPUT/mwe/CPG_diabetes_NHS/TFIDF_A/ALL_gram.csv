Use methods to measure HbA1c that have been calibrated according to	Last updated May 2017 on a case-by-case basis, with particular consideration for people who are older or frail, for adults with type 2 diabetes: who are unlikely to achieve longer-term risk-reduction benefits, for example, people with a reduced life expectancy for whom tight blood glucose control poses a high risk of the consequences of hypoglycaemia, for example, people who are at risk of falling, people who have impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia, and people who drive or operate machinery as part of their job for whom intensive management would not be appropriate, for example, people with significant comorbidities. 0 If adults with type 2 diabetes achieve an HbA1c level that is lower than their target and they are not experiencing hypoglycaemia, encourage them to maintain it	Last updated May 2017 2 In adults with type 2 diabetes, review the dose of metformin if the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is below 45 ml minute 3m2:	Prescribe metformin with caution for those at risk of a sudden deterioration in kidney function and those at risk of eGFR falling below 45 ml minute 3m2. 3 In adults with type 2 diabetes, if metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated, consider initial drug treatment with: a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor or pioglitazone or a sulfonylurea. 4 In adults with type 2 diabetes, do not offer or continue pioglitazone if they have any of the following: heart failure or history of heart failure	Treatment with sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors , may be appropriate for some adults with type 2 diabetes if metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated (see NICE's guidance on canagliflozin, dapagliflozin and empagliflozin as monotherapies for treating type 2 diabetes).	First intensification of drug treatment 5 In adults with type 2 diabetes, if initial drug treatment with metformin has not continued to control HbA1c to below the person's individually agreed threshold for intensification, consider dual therapy with: metformin and a DPP-4 inhibitor or metformin and pioglitazone or metformin and a sulfonylurea. 6 In adults with type 2 diabetes, if metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated and initial drug treatment has not continued to control HbA1c to below the person's individually agreed threshold for intensification, consider dual therapy with: a DPP-4 inhibitor and pioglitazone or a DPP-4 inhibitor and a sulfonylurea or pioglitazone and a sulfonylurea.	Second intensification of drug treatment 7 In adults with type 2 diabetes, if dual therapy with metformin and another oral drug (see recommendation 5) has not continued to control HbA1c to below the person's individually agreed threshold for intensification, consider either: triple therapy with: metformin, a DPP-4 inhibitor and a sulfonylurea or metformin, pioglitazone and a sulfonylurea or starting insulin-based treatment (see recommendations 2– 4). 8 If triple therapy with metformin and 2 other oral drugs (see recommendation 7) is not effective, not tolerated or contraindicated, consider combination therapy with metformin, a sulfonylurea and a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) mimetic for adults with type 2 diabetes who: have a BMI of 35 kg m2 or higher (adjust accordingly for people from black, Asian and other minority ethnic groups) and specific psychological or other medical problems associated with obesity or have a BMI lower than 35 kg m2and: for whom insulin therapy would have significant occupational implications or weight loss would benefit other significant obesity-related comorbidities. 9 Only continue GLP-1 mimetic therapy if the person with type 2 diabetes has had a beneficial metabolic response (a reduction of at least 11 mmol mol  percent in	HbA1c and a weight loss of at least 3percent of initial body weight in 6 months). 0 In adults with type 2 diabetes, if metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated, and if dual therapy with 2 oral drugs (see recommendation 6) has not continued to control HbA1c to below the person's individually agreed threshold for intensification, consider insulin-based treatment (see recommendations 2– 4).

Rescue therapy at any phase of treatment 8 If an adult with type 2 diabetes is symptomatically hyperglycaemic, consider insulin (see recommendations 2– 4) or a sulfonylurea, and review treatment when blood glucose control has been achieved.	Algorithm for blood glucose lowering therapy in adults with type 2 diabetes	Review the continued need for other blood glucose lowering therapies . 4 Start insulin therapy for adults with type 2 diabetes from a choice of a number of insulin types and regimens:	Consider pre-mixed (biphasic) preparations that include short-acting insulin analogues, rather than pre-mixed (biphasic) preparations that include short-acting human insulin preparations, if: a person prefers injecting insulin immediately before a meal or hypoglycaemia is a problem or blood glucose levels rise markedly after meals. 5 Consider switching to insulin detemir or insulin glargine from NPH insulin in adults with type 2 diabetes: who do not reach their target HbA1c because of significant hypoglycaemia or who experience significant hypoglycaemia on NPH insulin irrespective of the level of	Last updated May 2017 who need help from a carer or healthcare professional to administer insulin injections and for whom switching to one of the long-acting insulin analogues would reduce the number of daily injections. 6 Monitor adults with type 2 diabetes who are on a basal insulin regimen (NPH insulin, insulin detemir or insulin glargine ) for the need for short-acting insulin before meals (or a pre-mixed biphasic insulin preparation). 7 Monitor adults with type 2 diabetes who are on pre-mixed (biphasic) insulin for the need for a further injection of short-acting insulin before meals or for a change to a basal bolus regimen with NPH insulin or insulin detemir or insulin glargine , if blood glucose control remains inadequate.
