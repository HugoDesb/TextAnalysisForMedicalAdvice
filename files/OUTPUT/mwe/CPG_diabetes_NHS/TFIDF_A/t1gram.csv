Initial drug treatment1.6.19 Offer standard-release metformin as the initial drug treatment for adults with type 2 diabetes. 1.6.20 Gradually increase the dose of standard-release metformin over several weeks to minimise the risk of gastrointestinal side effects in adults with type 2 diabetes. 1.6.21 If an adult with type 2 diabetes experiences gastrointestinal side effects with standard-release metformin, consider a trial of modified-release metformin..	Prescribe metformin with caution for those at risk of a sudden deterioration in kidneyfunction and those at risk of eGFR falling below 45 ml minute 1.73m2. 1.6.23 In adults with type 2 diabetes, if metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated, consider initial drug treatment with: a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor or pioglitazone or a sulfonylurea. 1.6.24 In adults with type 2 diabetes, do not offer or continue pioglitazone if they have any of the following: heart failure or history of heart failure.	First intensification of drug treatment1.6.25 In adults with type 2 diabetes, if initial drug treatment with metformin has not continued to control HbA1c to below the person's individually agreed threshold for intensification, consider dual therapy with: metformin and a DPP-4 inhibitor or metformin and pioglitazone or metformin and a sulfonylurea. 1.6.26 In adults with type 2 diabetes, if metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated and initial drug treatment has not continued to control HbA1c to below the person's individually agreed threshold for intensification, consider dual therapy with: a DPP-4 inhibitor and pioglitazone or a DPP-4 inhibitor and a sulfonylurea or pioglitazone and a sulfonylurea..	Second intensification of drug treatment1.6.27 In adults with type 2 diabetes, if dual therapy with metformin and another oral drug (see recommendation 1.6.25) has not continued to control HbA1c to below the person's individually agreed threshold for intensification, consider either: triple therapy with: metformin, a DPP-4 inhibitor and a sulfonylurea or metformin, pioglitazone and a sulfonylurea or starting insulin-based treatment (see recommendations 1.6.32–1.6.34). 1.6.28 If triple therapy with metformin and 2 other oral drugs (see recommendation 1.6.27) is not effective, not tolerated or contraindicated, consider combination therapy with metformin, a sulfonylurea and a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) mimetic for adults with type 2 diabetes who: have a BMI of 35 kg m2 or higher (adjust accordingly for people from black, Asian and other minority ethnic groups) and specific psychological or other medical problems associated with obesity or have a BMI lower than 35 kg m2and: for whom insulin therapy would have significant occupational implications or weight loss would benefit other significant obesity-related comorbidities. 1.6.29 Only continue GLP-1 mimetic therapy if the person with type 2 diabetes has had a beneficial metabolic response (a reduction of at least 11 mmol mol 1.0percent in.	HbA1c and a weight loss of at least 3percent of initial body weight in 6 months).1.6.30 In adults with type 2 diabetes, if metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated, and if dual therapy with 2 oral drugs (see recommendation 1.6.26) has not continued to control HbA1c to below the person's individually agreed threshold for intensification, consider insulin-based treatment (see recommendations 1.6.32–1.6.34)..	Consider, as an alternative to NPH insulin, using insulin detemir or insulin glargine if:the person needs assistance from a carer or healthcare professional to inject insulin, and use of insulin detemir or insulin glargine would reduce the frequency of injections from twice to once daily or the person's lifestyle is restricted by recurrent symptomatic hypoglycaemic episodes or the person would otherwise need twice-daily NPH insulin injections in combination with oral glucose-lowering drugs..

Provide lifestyle advice (diet and exercise) at the same time.1.4.4 Provide lifestyle advice (see section 1.3 in this guideline and the lifestyle interventions section in hypertension in adults NICE guideline CG127) if blood.	Page 15of 44 pressure is confirmed as being consistently above 140 80 mmHg (or above 130 80 mmHg if there is kidney, eye or cerebrovascular damage). 1.4.5 Add medications if lifestyle advice does not reduce blood pressure to below 140 80 mmHg (below 130 80 mmHg if there is kidney, eye or cerebrovascular damage). 1.4.6 Monitor blood pressure every 1–2 months, and intensify therapy if the person is already on antihypertensive drug treatment, until the blood pressure is consistently below 140 80 mmHg (below 130 80 mmHg if there is kidney, eye or cerebrovascular damage). 1.4.7 First-line antihypertensive drug treatment should be a once-daily, generic angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor.	Caribbean family origin should be an ACE inhibitor plus either a diuretic or ageneric calcium-channel blocker. 1.4.9 A calcium-channel blocker should be the first-line antihypertensive drug treatment for a woman for whom, after an informed discussion, it is agreed there is a possibility of her becoming pregnant. 1.4.10 For a person with continuing intolerance to an ACE inhibitor (other than renal deterioration or hyperkalaemia), substitute an angiotensin II-receptor antagonist for the ACE inhibitor. 1.4.11 Do not combine an ACE inhibitor with an angiotensin II-receptor antagonist to treat hypertension. 1.4.12 If the person's blood pressure is not reduced to the individually agreed target with first-line therapy, add a calcium-channel blocker or a diuretic (usually a thiazide or thiazide-related diuretic).	Page 16of 44 1.4.13 If the person's blood pressure is not reduced to the individually agreed target with triple therapy, add an alpha-blocker, a beta-blocker or a potassium-sparing diuretic (the last with caution if the person is already taking an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin II-receptor antagonist). 1.4.14 Monitor the blood pressure of a person who has attained and consistently remained at his or her blood pressure target every 4–6 months.	Check forpossible adverse effects of antihypertensive drug treatment – including the risks from unnecessarily low blood pressure. 1.5 Antiplatelet therapy 1.5.1 Do not offer antiplatelet therapy (aspirin or clopidogrel) for adults with type 2 diabetes without cardiovascular disease. 1.5.2 For guidance on the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults with type 2 diabetes, see the NICE guidelines on cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction. 1.6 Blood glucose management.	Measurement1.6.1 In adults with type 2 diabetes, measure HbA1c levels at: 3–6-monthly intervals (tailored to individual needs), until the HbA1c is stable on unchanging therapy 6-monthly intervals once the HbA1c level and blood glucose lowering therapy are stable. 1.6.2 Use methods to measure HbA1c that have been calibrated according to.	International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) standardisation.1.6.3 If HbA1c monitoring is invalid because of disturbed erythrocyte turnover or abnormal haemoglobin type, estimate trends in blood glucose control using one.	Page 18of 44 on a case-by-case basis, with particular consideration for people who are older or frail, for adults with type 2 diabetes: who are unlikely to achieve longer-term risk-reduction benefits, for example, people with a reduced life expectancy for whom tight blood glucose control poses a high risk of the consequences of hypoglycaemia, for example, people who are at risk of falling, people who have impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia, and people who drive or operate machinery as part of their job for whom intensive management would not be appropriate, for example, people with significant comorbidities. 1.6.10 If adults with type 2 diabetes achieve an HbA1c level that is lower than their target and they are not experiencing hypoglycaemia, encourage them to maintain it.	Self-monitoring of blood glucose1.6.12 Take the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) At a glance guide to the current medical standards of fitness to drive into account when offering self-monitoring of blood glucose levels for adults with type 2 diabetes. 1.6.13 Do not routinely offer self-monitoring of blood glucose levels for adults with type 2 diabetes unless: the person is on insulin or there is evidence of hypoglycaemic episodes or the person is on oral medication that may increase their risk of hypoglycaemia while driving or operating machinery or.	For more information, seethe NICE guideline on diabetes in pregnancy. 1.6.14 Consider short-term self-monitoring of blood glucose levels in adults with type 2 diabetes (and review treatment as necessary): when starting treatment with oral or intravenous corticosteroids or to confirm suspected hypoglycaemia. 1.6.15 Be aware that adults with type 2 diabetes who have acute intercurrent illness are at risk of worsening hyperglycaemia.	Review treatment as necessary.1.6.16 If adults with type 2 diabetes are self-monitoring their blood glucose levels, carry out a structured assessment at least annually.	The assessment shouldinclude: the person's self-monitoring skills the quality and frequency of testing checking that the person knows how to interpret the blood glucose results and what action to take the impact on the person's quality of life the continued benefit to the person the equipment used..	Rescue therapy at any phase of treatment1.6.18 If an adult with type 2 diabetes is symptomatically hyperglycaemic, consider insulin (see recommendations 1.6.32–1.6.34) or a sulfonylurea, and review treatment when blood glucose control has been achieved..	Algorithm for blood glucose lowering therapy in adults with type 2 diabetes.	Review thecontinued need for other blood glucose lowering therapies . 1.6.34 Start insulin therapy for adults with type 2 diabetes from a choice of a number of insulin types and regimens:.	Consider pre-mixed (biphasic) preparations that include short-acting insulinanalogues, rather than pre-mixed (biphasic) preparations that include short-acting human insulin preparations, if: a person prefers injecting insulin immediately before a meal or hypoglycaemia is a problem or blood glucose levels rise markedly after meals. 1.6.35 Consider switching to insulin detemir or insulin glargine from NPH insulin in adults with type 2 diabetes: who do not reach their target HbA1c because of significant hypoglycaemia or who experience significant hypoglycaemia on NPH insulin irrespective of the level of.	Page 26of 44 who need help from a carer or healthcare professional to administer insulin injections and for whom switching to one of the long-acting insulin analogues would reduce the number of daily injections. 1.6.36 Monitor adults with type 2 diabetes who are on a basal insulin regimen (NPH insulin, insulin detemir or insulin glargine ) for the need for short-acting insulin before meals (or a pre-mixed biphasic insulin preparation). 1.6.37 Monitor adults with type 2 diabetes who are on pre-mixed (biphasic) insulin for the need for a further injection of short-acting insulin before meals or for a change to a basal bolus regimen with NPH insulin or insulin detemir or insulin glargine , if blood glucose control remains inadequate..	Gastroparesis1.7.1 Think about a diagnosis of gastroparesis in adults with type 2 diabetes with erratic blood glucose control or unexplained gastric bloating or vomiting, taking into account possible alternative diagnoses 2009, amended 2015 1.7.2 For adults with type 2 diabetes who have vomiting caused by gastroparesis, explain that: there is not strong evidence that any available antiemetic therapy is effective some people have had benefit with domperidone , erythromycin or metoclopramide . the strongest evidence for effectiveness is for domperidone , but prescribers must.
