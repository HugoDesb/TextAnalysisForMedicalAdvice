Initial drug treatment1.6.19 Offer standard-release metformin as the initial drug treatment for adults with type 2 diabetes. 1.6.20 Gradually increase the dose of standard-release metformin over several weeks to minimise the risk of gastrointestinal side effects in adults with type 2 diabetes. 1.6.21 If an adult with type 2 diabetes experiences gastrointestinal side effects with standard-release metformin, consider a trial of modified-release metformin..	Prescribe metformin with caution for those at risk of a sudden deterioration in kidneyfunction and those at risk of eGFR falling below 45 ml minute 1.73m2. 1.6.23 In adults with type 2 diabetes, if metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated, consider initial drug treatment with: a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor or pioglitazone or a sulfonylurea. 1.6.24 In adults with type 2 diabetes, do not offer or continue pioglitazone if they have any of the following: heart failure or history of heart failure.	First intensification of drug treatment1.6.25 In adults with type 2 diabetes, if initial drug treatment with metformin has not continued to control HbA1c to below the person's individually agreed threshold for intensification, consider dual therapy with: metformin and a DPP-4 inhibitor or metformin and pioglitazone or metformin and a sulfonylurea. 1.6.26 In adults with type 2 diabetes, if metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated and initial drug treatment has not continued to control HbA1c to below the person's individually agreed threshold for intensification, consider dual therapy with: a DPP-4 inhibitor and pioglitazone or a DPP-4 inhibitor and a sulfonylurea or pioglitazone and a sulfonylurea..	Second intensification of drug treatment1.6.27 In adults with type 2 diabetes, if dual therapy with metformin and another oral drug (see recommendation 1.6.25) has not continued to control HbA1c to below the person's individually agreed threshold for intensification, consider either: triple therapy with: metformin, a DPP-4 inhibitor and a sulfonylurea or metformin, pioglitazone and a sulfonylurea or starting insulin-based treatment (see recommendations 1.6.32–1.6.34). 1.6.28 If triple therapy with metformin and 2 other oral drugs (see recommendation 1.6.27) is not effective, not tolerated or contraindicated, consider combination therapy with metformin, a sulfonylurea and a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) mimetic for adults with type 2 diabetes who: have a BMI of 35 kg m2 or higher (adjust accordingly for people from black, Asian and other minority ethnic groups) and specific psychological or other medical problems associated with obesity or have a BMI lower than 35 kg m2and: for whom insulin therapy would have significant occupational implications or weight loss would benefit other significant obesity-related comorbidities. 1.6.29 Only continue GLP-1 mimetic therapy if the person with type 2 diabetes has had a beneficial metabolic response (a reduction of at least 11 mmol mol 1.0percent in.	HbA1c and a weight loss of at least 3percent of initial body weight in 6 months).1.6.30 In adults with type 2 diabetes, if metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated, and if dual therapy with 2 oral drugs (see recommendation 1.6.26) has not continued to control HbA1c to below the person's individually agreed threshold for intensification, consider insulin-based treatment (see recommendations 1.6.32–1.6.34)..	Consider, as an alternative to NPH insulin, using insulin detemir or insulin glargine if:the person needs assistance from a carer or healthcare professional to inject insulin, and use of insulin detemir or insulin glargine would reduce the frequency of injections from twice to once daily or the person's lifestyle is restricted by recurrent symptomatic hypoglycaemic episodes or the person would otherwise need twice-daily NPH insulin injections in combination with oral glucose-lowering drugs..

African or Caribbean family origin, or women for whom there is a possibility ofbecoming pregnant. 1.4.8 The first-line antihypertensive drug treatment for a person of African or.	Caribbean family origin should be an ACE inhibitor plus either a diuretic or ageneric calcium-channel blocker. 1.4.9 A calcium-channel blocker should be the first-line antihypertensive drug treatment for a woman for whom, after an informed discussion, it is agreed there is a possibility of her becoming pregnant. 1.4.10 For a person with continuing intolerance to an ACE inhibitor (other than renal deterioration or hyperkalaemia), substitute an angiotensin II-receptor antagonist for the ACE inhibitor. 1.4.11 Do not combine an ACE inhibitor with an angiotensin II-receptor antagonist to treat hypertension. 1.4.12 If the person's blood pressure is not reduced to the individually agreed target with first-line therapy, add a calcium-channel blocker or a diuretic (usually a thiazide or thiazide-related diuretic).	Add the other drug (that is, thecalcium-channel blocker or diuretic) if the target is not reached with dual therapy 2009, amended 2015.	Check forpossible adverse effects of antihypertensive drug treatment – including the risks from unnecessarily low blood pressure. 1.5 Antiplatelet therapy 1.5.1 Do not offer antiplatelet therapy (aspirin or clopidogrel) for adults with type 2 diabetes without cardiovascular disease. 1.5.2 For guidance on the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults with type 2 diabetes, see the NICE guidelines on cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction. 1.6 Blood glucose management.	Encourage them to achieve the target and maintain it unless anyresulting adverse effects (including hypoglycaemia), or their efforts to achieve their target, impair their quality of life. 1.6.6 Offer lifestyle advice and drug treatment to support adults with type 2 diabetes to achieve and maintain their HbA1c target (see section 1.3).	For moreinformation about supporting adherence, see the NICE guideline on medicines adherence. 1.6.7 For adults with type 2 diabetes managed either by lifestyle and diet, or by lifestyle and diet combined with a single drug not associated with hypoglycaemia, support the person to aim for an HbA1c level of 48 mmol mol (6.5percent).	For adults on a drug associated with hypoglycaemia, support the personto aim for an HbA1c level of 53 mmol mol (7.0percent). 1.6.8 In adults with type 2 diabetes, if HbA1c levels are not adequately controlled by a single drug and rise to 58 mmol mol (7.5percent) or higher: reinforce advice about diet, lifestyle and adherence to drug treatment and support the person to aim for an HbA1c level of 53 mmol mol (7.0percent) and intensify drug treatment. 1.6.9 Consider relaxing the target HbA1c level (see recommendations 1.6.7 and 1.6.8).

Review treatment as necessary.1.6.16 If adults with type 2 diabetes are self-monitoring their blood glucose levels, carry out a structured assessment at least annually.	The assessment shouldinclude: the person's self-monitoring skills the quality and frequency of testing checking that the person knows how to interpret the blood glucose results and what action to take the impact on the person's quality of life the continued benefit to the person the equipment used..	Insulin-based treatments1.6.32 When starting insulin therapy in adults with type 2 diabetes, use a structured programme employing active insulin dose titration that encompasses: injection technique, including rotating injection sites and avoiding repeated injections at the same point within sites continuing telephone support self-monitoring dose titration to target levels dietary understanding.
