Do not use antidepressants routinely to treat persistent subthreshold depressive symptoms or mild depression because the risk–benefit ratio is poor, but consider them for people with: a past history of moderate or severe depression or initial presentation of subthreshold depressive symptoms that have been present for a long period (typically at least 2 years) or	Although there is evidence that St John's wort may be of benefit in mild or moderate depression, practitioners should: not prescribe or advise its use by people with depression because of uncertainty about appropriate doses, persistence of effect, variation in the nature of preparations and potential serious interactions with other drugs (including oral contraceptives, anticoagulants and anticonvulsants) advise people with depression of the different potencies of the preparations available and of the potential serious interactions of St John's wort with other drugs.	For people with persistent subthreshold depressive symptoms or mild to moderate depression who have not benefited from a low-intensity psychosocial intervention, discuss the relative merits of different interventions with the person and provide: an antidepressant (normally a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor SSRI) or a high-intensity psychological intervention, normally one of the following options:	For people with depression who decline an antidepressant, CBT, IPT, behavioural activation and behavioural couples therapy, consider: counselling for people with persistent subthreshold depressive symptoms or mild to moderate depression short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy for people with mild to moderate depression.	In particular, consider prescribing a gastroprotective drug in older people who are taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or aspirin.	Be aware that: compared with other equally effective antidepressants recommended for routine use in primary care, venlafaxine is associated with a greater risk of death from overdose tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), except for lofepramine, are associated with the greatest risk in overdose.	For example: the potential for higher doses of venlafaxine to exacerbate cardiac arrhythmias and the need to monitor the person's blood pressure the possible exacerbation of hypertension with venlafaxine and duloxetine the potential for postural hypotension and arrhythmias with TCAs the need for haematological monitoring with mianserin in elderly people.	Non-reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), such as phenelzine, should normally be prescribed only by specialist mental health professionals.	For people started on antidepressants who are not considered to be at increased risk of suicide, normally see them after 2 weeks	A person with depression started on antidepressants who is considered to present an increased suicide risk or is younger than 30 years (because of the potential increased prevalence of suicidal thoughts in the early stages of antidepressant treatment for this group) should normally be seen after 1 week and frequently thereafter as appropriate until the risk is no longer considered clinically important.	Last updated April 2018 treatment, provide appropriate information and consider one of the following strategies: monitor symptoms closely where side effects are mild and acceptable to the person or stop the antidepressant or change to a different antidepressant if the person prefers or in discussion with the person, consider short-term concomitant treatment with a benzodiazepine if anxiety, agitation and or insomnia are problematic (except in people with chronic symptoms of anxiety); this should usually be for no longer than 2 weeks in order to prevent the development of dependence.	People who start on low-dose TCAs and who have a clear clinical response can be maintained on that dose with careful monitoring. 0 If the person's depression shows no improvement after 2 to 4 weeks with the first antidepressant, check that the drug has been taken regularly and in the prescribed dose. 1 If response is absent or minimal after 3 to 4 weeks of treatment with a therapeutic dose of an antidepressant, increase the level of support (for example, by weekly face-to-face or telephone contact) and consider: increasing the dose in line with the SPC if there are no significant side effects or switching to another antidepressant as described in section if there are side effects or if the person prefers. 2 If the person's depression shows some improvement by 4 weeks, continue treatment for another 2 to 4 weeks	Also consider providing: two sessions per week for the first 2 to 3 weeks of treatment for people with moderate or severe depression follow-up sessions typically consisting of three to four sessions over the following 3 to 6 months for all people with depression.	For people with severe depression, consider providing two sessions per week for the first 2 to 3 weeks of treatment.	Also consider providing: two sessions per week for the first 3 to 4 weeks of treatment for people with moderate or severe depression follow-up sessions typically consisting of three to four sessions over the following 3 to 6 months for all people with depression.	For all people with persistent subthreshold depressive symptoms or mild to moderate depression having counselling, the duration of treatment should typically be in the range of six to ten sessions over 8 to 12 weeks.	For people with long-standing moderate or severe depression who would benefit from additional social or vocational support, consider: befriending as an adjunct to pharmacological or psychological treatments; befriending should be by trained volunteers providing, typically, at least weekly contact for between 2 and 6 months a rehabilitation programme if a person's depression has resulted in loss of work or disengagement from other social activities over a longer term.	For people with severe depression and those with moderate depression and complex problems, consider: referring to specialist mental health services for a programme of coordinated multiprofessional care providing collaborative care if the depression is in the context of a chronic physical health problem with associated functional impairment .

Referral 1 For a person whose depression has failed to respond to various strategies for augmentation and combination treatments, consider referral to a practitioner with a specialist interest in treating depression, or to a specialist service.	Treatment choice should be influenced by: previous treatment history, including the consequences of a relapse, residual symptoms, response to previous treatment and any discontinuation symptoms the person's preference.	If one medication is stopped, it should usually be the augmenting agent	People with depression who are considered to be at significant risk of relapse (including those who have relapsed despite antidepressant treatment or who are unable or choose not to continue antidepressant treatment) or who have residual symptoms, should be offered one of the following psychological interventions: individual CBT for people who have relapsed despite antidepressant medication and for people with a significant history of depression and residual symptoms despite treatment mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for people who are currently well but have experienced three or more previous episodes of depression.	If the duration of treatment needs to be extended to achieve remission it should: consist of two sessions per week for the first 2 to 3 weeks of treatment include additional follow-up sessions, typically consisting of four to six sessions over	Last updated April 2018 the following 6 months. 0 Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy should normally be delivered in groups of 8 to 15 participants and consist of weekly 2-hour meetings over 8 weeks and four follow-up sessions in the 12 months after the end of treatment.	Explain that symptoms are usually mild and self-limiting over about 1 week, but can be severe, particularly if the drug is stopped abruptly.	If discontinuation symptoms occur: monitor symptoms and reassure the person if symptoms are mild consider reintroducing the original antidepressant at the dose that was effective (or another antidepressant with a longer half-life from the same class) if symptoms are severe, and reduce the dose gradually while monitoring symptoms. 0 Step 4: complex and severe depression	Referral to specialist mental health services should normally be for people with depression who are at significant risk of self-harm, have psychotic symptoms, require complex multiprofessional care, or where an expert opinion on treatment and management is needed.	The assessment of a person with depression referred to specialist mental health services should include: their symptom profile, suicide risk and, where appropriate, previous treatment history	In specialist mental health services, after thoroughly reviewing previous treatments for depression, consider reintroducing previous treatments that have been inadequately delivered or adhered to.	Medication in secondary care mental health services should be started under the supervision of a consultant psychiatrist.

When families or carers are involved in supporting a person with severe or chronic depression, consider: providing written and verbal information on depression and its management, including how families or carers can support the person offering a carer's assessment of their caring, physical and mental health needs if necessary providing information about local family or carer support groups and voluntary organisations, and helping families or carers to access these negotiating between the person and their family or carer about confidentiality and the sharing of information.	Principles for assessment, coordination of care and choosing treatments	When assessing a person who may have depression, conduct a comprehensive assessment that does not rely simply on a symptom count	Ensure competence in: culturally sensitive assessment using different explanatory models of depression addressing cultural and ethnic differences when developing and implementing treatment plans working with families from diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds.

Ensure that consent to treatment is based on the provision of clear information (which should also be available in written form) about the intervention, covering: what it comprises what is expected of the person while having it likely outcomes (including any side effects).	In addition to assessing symptoms and associated functional impairment, consider how the following factors may have affected the development, course and severity of a person's depression: any history of depression and comorbid mental health or physical disorders any past history of mood elevation (to determine if the depression may be part of bipolar disorder )	Be respectful of, and sensitive to, diverse cultural, ethnic and religious backgrounds when working with people with depression, and be aware of the possible variations in the presentation of depression	When assessing a person with suspected depression, be aware of any learning disabilities or acquired cognitive impairments, and if necessary consider consulting with a relevant specialist when developing treatment plans and strategies.	If there is a risk of self-harm or suicide: assess whether the person has adequate social support and is aware of sources of help arrange help appropriate to the level of risk (see section ) advise the person to seek further help if the situation deteriorates.	The stepped-care model provides a framework in which to organise the provision of services, and supports patients, carers and practitioners in identifying and accessing the most effective interventions (see figure 1)	In stepped care the least intrusive, most effective intervention is provided first; if a person does not benefit from the intervention initially offered, or declines an intervention, they should be offered an appropriate intervention from the next step.

When the person has an anxiety disorder and comorbid depression or depressive symptoms, consult the NICE guideline for the relevant anxiety disorder (see find guidance) and consider treating the anxiety disorder first (since effective treatment of the anxiety disorder will often improve the depression or the depressive symptoms).	Although there is evidence that St John's wort may be of benefit in mild or moderate depression, practitioners should: not prescribe or advise its use by people with depression because of uncertainty about appropriate doses, persistence of effect, variation in the nature of preparations and potential serious interactions with other drugs (including oral contraceptives, anticoagulants and anticonvulsants) advise people with depression of the different potencies of the preparations available and of the potential serious interactions of St John's wort with other drugs.	For people with persistent subthreshold depressive symptoms or mild to moderate depression who have not benefited from a low-intensity psychosocial intervention, discuss the relative merits of different interventions with the person and provide: an antidepressant (normally a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor SSRI) or a high-intensity psychological intervention, normally one of the following options:	The choice of intervention should be influenced by the: duration of the episode of depression and the trajectory of symptoms previous course of depression and response to treatment likelihood of adherence to treatment and any potential adverse effects person's treatment preference and priorities.	Discuss antidepressant treatment options with the person with depression, covering: the choice of antidepressant, including any anticipated adverse events, for example side effects and discontinuation symptoms (see recommendation ), and potential interactions with concomitant medication or physical health problems their perception of the efficacy and tolerability of any antidepressants they have previously taken.	In particular, consider prescribing a gastroprotective drug in older people who are taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or aspirin.	Be aware that: compared with other equally effective antidepressants recommended for routine use in primary care, venlafaxine is associated with a greater risk of death from overdose tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), except for lofepramine, are associated with the greatest risk in overdose.	When prescribing antidepressants, explore any concerns the person with depression has about taking medication, explain fully the reasons for prescribing, and provide information about taking antidepressants, including: the gradual development of the full antidepressant effect the importance of taking medication as prescribed and the need to continue treatment after remission potential side effects the potential for interactions with other medications the risk and nature of discontinuation symptoms with all antidepressants, particularly with drugs with a shorter half-life (such as paroxetine and venlafaxine), and how these symptoms can be minimised the fact that addiction does not occur with antidepressants.	Last updated April 2018 treatment, provide appropriate information and consider one of the following strategies: monitor symptoms closely where side effects are mild and acceptable to the person or stop the antidepressant or change to a different antidepressant if the person prefers or in discussion with the person, consider short-term concomitant treatment with a benzodiazepine if anxiety, agitation and or insomnia are problematic (except in people with chronic symptoms of anxiety); this should usually be for no longer than 2 weeks in order to prevent the development of dependence.	People who start on low-dose TCAs and who have a clear clinical response can be maintained on that dose with careful monitoring. 0 If the person's depression shows no improvement after 2 to 4 weeks with the first antidepressant, check that the drug has been taken regularly and in the prescribed dose. 1 If response is absent or minimal after 3 to 4 weeks of treatment with a therapeutic dose of an antidepressant, increase the level of support (for example, by weekly face-to-face or telephone contact) and consider: increasing the dose in line with the SPC if there are no significant side effects or switching to another antidepressant as described in section if there are side effects or if the person prefers. 2 If the person's depression shows some improvement by 4 weeks, continue treatment for another 2 to 4 weeks	When prescribing antidepressants for older people: prescribe at an age-appropriate dose taking into account the effect of general physical health and concomitant medication on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics	It is likely to be effective only when provided as part of a more complex intervention.

The following strategies should not be used routinely: augmentation of an antidepressant with a benzodiazepine for more than 2 weeks as there is a risk of dependence augmentation of an antidepressant with buspirone , carbamazepine , lamotrigine or valproate as there is insufficient evidence for their use augmentation of an antidepressant with pindolol or thyroid hormones as there is inconsistent evidence of effectiveness .	People who have had multiple episodes of depression, and who have had a good response to treatment with an antidepressant and an augmenting agent, should remain on this combination after remission if they find the side effects tolerable and acceptable	If discontinuation symptoms occur: monitor symptoms and reassure the person if symptoms are mild consider reintroducing the original antidepressant at the dose that was effective (or another antidepressant with a longer half-life from the same class) if symptoms are severe, and reduce the dose gradually while monitoring symptoms. 0 Step 4: complex and severe depression	Consider inpatient treatment for people with depression who are at significant risk of suicide, self-harm or self-neglect.

Explain that symptoms are usually mild and self-limiting over about 1 week, but can be severe, particularly if the drug is stopped abruptly.	Inform the person that they should seek advice from their practitioner if they experience significant discontinuation symptoms	If discontinuation symptoms occur: monitor symptoms and reassure the person if symptoms are mild consider reintroducing the original antidepressant at the dose that was effective (or another antidepressant with a longer half-life from the same class) if symptoms are severe, and reduce the dose gradually while monitoring symptoms. 0 Step 4: complex and severe depression	Referral to specialist mental health services should normally be for people with depression who are at significant risk of self-harm, have psychotic symptoms, require complex multiprofessional care, or where an expert opinion on treatment and management is needed.	The assessment of a person with depression referred to specialist mental health services should include: their symptom profile, suicide risk and, where appropriate, previous treatment history	For people who have depression with psychotic symptoms, consider augmenting the current treatment plan with antipsychotic medication (although the optimum dose and duration of treatment are unknown).

The wording used in the recommendations in this guideline (for example, words such as 'offer' and 'consider') denotes the certainty with which the recommendation is made (the strength of the recommendation)	Consider relaxing the target HbA1c level (see recommendations and )	Last updated May 2017 on a case-by-case basis, with particular consideration for people who are older or frail, for adults with type 2 diabetes: who are unlikely to achieve longer-term risk-reduction benefits, for example, people with a reduced life expectancy for whom tight blood glucose control poses a high risk of the consequences of hypoglycaemia, for example, people who are at risk of falling, people who have impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia, and people who drive or operate machinery as part of their job for whom intensive management would not be appropriate, for example, people with significant comorbidities. 0 If adults with type 2 diabetes achieve an HbA1c level that is lower than their target and they are not experiencing hypoglycaemia, encourage them to maintain it	For more information, see the NICE guideline on diabetes in pregnancy. 4 Consider short-term self-monitoring of blood glucose levels in adults with type 2 diabetes (and review treatment as necessary): when starting treatment with oral or intravenous corticosteroids or to confirm suspected hypoglycaemia. 5 Be aware that adults with type 2 diabetes who have acute intercurrent illness are at risk of worsening hyperglycaemia	Rescue therapy at any phase of treatment 8 If an adult with type 2 diabetes is symptomatically hyperglycaemic, consider insulin (see recommendations 2– 4) or a sulfonylurea, and review treatment when blood glucose control has been achieved.	Initial drug treatment 9 Offer standard-release metformin as the initial drug treatment for adults with type 2 diabetes. 0 Gradually increase the dose of standard-release metformin over several weeks to minimise the risk of gastrointestinal side effects in adults with type 2 diabetes. 1 If an adult with type 2 diabetes experiences gastrointestinal side effects with standard-release metformin, consider a trial of modified-release metformin.	Prescribe metformin with caution for those at risk of a sudden deterioration in kidney function and those at risk of eGFR falling below 45 ml minute 3m2. 3 In adults with type 2 diabetes, if metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated, consider initial drug treatment with: a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor or pioglitazone or a sulfonylurea. 4 In adults with type 2 diabetes, do not offer or continue pioglitazone if they have any of the following: heart failure or history of heart failure	First intensification of drug treatment 5 In adults with type 2 diabetes, if initial drug treatment with metformin has not continued to control HbA1c to below the person's individually agreed threshold for intensification, consider dual therapy with: metformin and a DPP-4 inhibitor or metformin and pioglitazone or metformin and a sulfonylurea. 6 In adults with type 2 diabetes, if metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated and initial drug treatment has not continued to control HbA1c to below the person's individually agreed threshold for intensification, consider dual therapy with: a DPP-4 inhibitor and pioglitazone or a DPP-4 inhibitor and a sulfonylurea or pioglitazone and a sulfonylurea.	Second intensification of drug treatment 7 In adults with type 2 diabetes, if dual therapy with metformin and another oral drug (see recommendation 5) has not continued to control HbA1c to below the person's individually agreed threshold for intensification, consider either: triple therapy with: metformin, a DPP-4 inhibitor and a sulfonylurea or metformin, pioglitazone and a sulfonylurea or starting insulin-based treatment (see recommendations 2– 4). 8 If triple therapy with metformin and 2 other oral drugs (see recommendation 7) is not effective, not tolerated or contraindicated, consider combination therapy with metformin, a sulfonylurea and a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) mimetic for adults with type 2 diabetes who: have a BMI of 35 kg m2 or higher (adjust accordingly for people from black, Asian and other minority ethnic groups) and specific psychological or other medical problems associated with obesity or have a BMI lower than 35 kg m2and: for whom insulin therapy would have significant occupational implications or weight loss would benefit other significant obesity-related comorbidities. 9 Only continue GLP-1 mimetic therapy if the person with type 2 diabetes has had a beneficial metabolic response (a reduction of at least 11 mmol mol  percent in	HbA1c and a weight loss of at least 3percent of initial body weight in 6 months). 0 In adults with type 2 diabetes, if metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated, and if dual therapy with 2 oral drugs (see recommendation 6) has not continued to control HbA1c to below the person's individually agreed threshold for intensification, consider insulin-based treatment (see recommendations 2– 4).	Consider pre-mixed (biphasic) preparations that include short-acting insulin analogues, rather than pre-mixed (biphasic) preparations that include short-acting human insulin preparations, if: a person prefers injecting insulin immediately before a meal or hypoglycaemia is a problem or blood glucose levels rise markedly after meals. 5 Consider switching to insulin detemir or insulin glargine from NPH insulin in adults with type 2 diabetes: who do not reach their target HbA1c because of significant hypoglycaemia or who experience significant hypoglycaemia on NPH insulin irrespective of the level of	For treating vomiting caused by gastroparesis in adults with type 2 diabetes: consider alternating use of erythomycin and metoclopramide consider domperidone only in exceptional circumstances (if domperidone is the only effective treatment) and in accordance with MHRA guidance.	If gastroparesis is suspected, consider referral to specialist services if: the differential diagnosis is in doubt or persistent or severe vomiting occurs.	When using tricyclic drugs and antihypertensive drug treatments in adults with type 2 diabetes who have autonomic neuropathy, be aware of the increased likelihood of side effects such as orthostatic hypotension.	Erectile dysfunction 3 Offer men with type 2 diabetes the opportunity to discuss erectile dysfunction as part of their annual review. 4 Assess, educate and support men with type 2 diabetes who have problematic erectile dysfunction, addressing contributory factors such as cardiovascular disease as well as possible treatment options. 5 Consider a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor to treat problematic erectile dysfunction in men with type 2 diabetes, initially choosing the drug with the lowest acquisition cost and taking into account any contraindications. 6 Following discussion, refer men with type 2 diabetes to a service offering other medical, surgical or psychological management of erectile dysfunction if treatment (including a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor, as appropriate) has been unsuccessful.	However, discuss with any person for whom repaglinide is being considered, that there is no licensed non-metformin-based combination containing repaglinide that can be offered at first intensification.	This guideline is published alongside 'Depression in adults with a chronic physical health problem: recognition and management' (NICE clinical guideline 91) which makes recommendations on the identification treatment and management of depression in adults aged 18 years and older who also have a chronic physical health problem.	Symptoms are considered persistent if they continue despite active monitoring and or low-intensity intervention, or have been present for a considerable time, typically several months (For a diagnosis of dysthymia, symptoms should be present for at least 2 years .)	Therefore it is also important to consider both personal past history and family history of depression when undertaking a diagnostic assessment (see appendix for further details).	Practitioners should consider using competence frameworks developed from the relevant treatment manual(s) and for all interventions should: receive regular high-quality supervision use routine outcome measures and ensure that the person with depression is involved in reviewing the efficacy of the treatment engage in monitoring and evaluation of treatment adherence and practitioner competence – for example, by using video and audio tapes, and external audit and scrutiny where appropriate.	Be alert to possible depression (particularly in people with a past history of depression or a chronic physical health problem with associated functional impairment) and consider asking people who may have depression two questions, specifically:	Last updated April 2018 consider offering one or more of the following interventions, guided by the person's preference: individual guided self-help based on the principles of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) computerised cognitive behavioural therapy (CCBT) a structured group physical activity programme.	Do not use antidepressants routinely to treat persistent subthreshold depressive symptoms or mild depression because the risk–benefit ratio is poor, but consider them for people with: a past history of moderate or severe depression or initial presentation of subthreshold depressive symptoms that have been present for a long period (typically at least 2 years) or subthreshold depressive symptoms or mild depression that persist(s) after other interventions.

Ensure that consent to treatment is based on the provision of clear information (which should also be available in written form) about the intervention, covering: what it comprises what is expected of the person while having it likely outcomes (including any side effects).	For people with recurrent severe depression or depression with psychotic symptoms and for those who have been treated under the Mental Health Act, consider developing advance decisions and advance statements collaboratively with the person	When families or carers are involved in supporting a person with severe or chronic depression, consider: providing written and verbal information on depression and its management, including how families or carers can support the person offering a carer's assessment of their caring, physical and mental health needs if necessary providing information about local family or carer support groups and voluntary organisations, and helping families or carers to access these negotiating between the person and their family or carer about confidentiality and the sharing of information.	In addition to assessing symptoms and associated functional impairment, consider how the following factors may have affected the development, course and severity of a person's depression: any history of depression and comorbid mental health or physical disorders any past history of mood elevation (to determine if the depression may be part of bipolar disorder )	When assessing a person with suspected depression, be aware of any learning disabilities or acquired cognitive impairments, and if necessary consider consulting with a relevant specialist when developing treatment plans and strategies.	Practitioners should consider using competence frameworks developed from the relevant treatment manual(s) and for all interventions should: receive regular high-quality supervision use routine outcome measures and ensure that the person with depression is involved in reviewing the efficacy of the treatment engage in monitoring and evaluation of treatment adherence and practitioner competence – for example, by using video and audio tapes, and external audit and scrutiny where appropriate.	Be alert to possible depression (particularly in people with a past history of depression or a chronic physical health problem with associated functional impairment) and consider asking people who may have depression two questions, specifically:	When assessing a person with suspected depression, consider using a validated measure (for example, for symptoms, functions and or disability) to inform and evaluate treatment.	For people with significant language or communication difficulties, for example people with sensory impairments or a learning disability, consider using the	If a person with depression presents considerable immediate risk to themselves or others, refer them urgently to specialist mental health services.	Last updated April 2018 consider increasing the level of support, such as more frequent direct or telephone contacts consider referral to specialist mental health services.	When the person has an anxiety disorder and comorbid depression or depressive symptoms, consult the NICE guideline for the relevant anxiety disorder (see find guidance) and consider treating the anxiety disorder first (since effective treatment of the anxiety disorder will often improve the depression or the depressive symptoms).	For people with persistent subthreshold depressive symptoms or mild to moderate depression, consider offering one or more of the following interventions, guided by the person's preference: individual guided self-help based on the principles of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) computerised cognitive behavioural therapy (CCBT) a structured group physical activity programme.	Consider group-based CBT for people with persistent subthreshold depressive symptoms or mild to moderate depression who decline low-intensity psychosocial interventions (see recommendation ).	Do not use antidepressants routinely to treat persistent subthreshold depressive symptoms or mild depression because the risk–benefit ratio is poor, but consider them for people with: a past history of moderate or severe depression or initial presentation of subthreshold depressive symptoms that have been present for a long period (typically at least 2 years) or	IPT) behavioural couples therapy for people who have a regular partner and where the relationship may contribute to the development or maintenance of depression, or where involving the partner is considered to be of potential therapeutic benefit.	For people with depression who decline an antidepressant, CBT, IPT, behavioural activation and behavioural couples therapy, consider: counselling for people with persistent subthreshold depressive symptoms or mild to moderate depression short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy for people with mild to moderate depression.	Discuss antidepressant treatment options with the person with depression, covering: the choice of antidepressant, including any anticipated adverse events, for example side effects and discontinuation symptoms (see recommendation ), and potential interactions with concomitant medication or physical health problems their perception of the efficacy and tolerability of any antidepressants they have previously taken.	In particular, consider prescribing a gastroprotective drug in older people who are taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or aspirin.	When prescribing antidepressants, explore any concerns the person with depression has about taking medication, explain fully the reasons for prescribing, and provide information about taking antidepressants, including: the gradual development of the full antidepressant effect the importance of taking medication as prescribed and the need to continue treatment after remission potential side effects the potential for interactions with other medications the risk and nature of discontinuation symptoms with all antidepressants, particularly with drugs with a shorter half-life (such as paroxetine and venlafaxine), and how these symptoms can be minimised the fact that addiction does not occur with antidepressants.	For people started on antidepressants who are not considered to be at increased risk of suicide, normally see them after 2 weeks	A person with depression started on antidepressants who is considered to present an increased suicide risk or is younger than 30 years (because of the potential increased prevalence of suicidal thoughts in the early stages of antidepressant treatment for this group) should normally be seen after 1 week and frequently thereafter as appropriate until the risk is no longer considered clinically important.	Last updated April 2018 treatment, provide appropriate information and consider one of the following strategies: monitor symptoms closely where side effects are mild and acceptable to the person or stop the antidepressant or change to a different antidepressant if the person prefers or in discussion with the person, consider short-term concomitant treatment with a benzodiazepine if anxiety, agitation and or insomnia are problematic (except in people with chronic symptoms of anxiety); this should usually be for no longer than 2 weeks in order to prevent the development of dependence.	People who start on low-dose TCAs and who have a clear clinical response can be maintained on that dose with careful monitoring. 0 If the person's depression shows no improvement after 2 to 4 weeks with the first antidepressant, check that the drug has been taken regularly and in the prescribed dose. 1 If response is absent or minimal after 3 to 4 weeks of treatment with a therapeutic dose of an antidepressant, increase the level of support (for example, by weekly face-to-face or telephone contact) and consider: increasing the dose in line with the SPC if there are no significant side effects or switching to another antidepressant as described in section if there are side effects or if the person prefers. 2 If the person's depression shows some improvement by 4 weeks, continue treatment for another 2 to 4 weeks	Also consider providing: two sessions per week for the first 2 to 3 weeks of treatment for people with moderate or severe depression follow-up sessions typically consisting of three to four sessions over the following 3 to 6 months for all people with depression.	For people with severe depression, consider providing two sessions per week for the first 2 to 3 weeks of treatment.	Also consider providing: two sessions per week for the first 3 to 4 weeks of treatment for people with moderate or severe depression follow-up sessions typically consisting of three to four sessions over the following 3 to 6 months for all people with depression.	For people with long-standing moderate or severe depression who would benefit from additional social or vocational support, consider: befriending as an adjunct to pharmacological or psychological treatments; befriending should be by trained volunteers providing, typically, at least weekly contact for between 2 and 6 months a rehabilitation programme if a person's depression has resulted in loss of work or disengagement from other social activities over a longer term.	For people with severe depression and those with moderate depression and complex problems, consider: referring to specialist mental health services for a programme of coordinated multiprofessional care providing collaborative care if the depression is in the context of a chronic physical health problem with associated functional impairment .	When reviewing drug treatment for a person with depression whose symptoms have not adequately responded to initial pharmacological interventions: check adherence to, and side effects from, initial treatment increase the frequency of appointments using outcome monitoring with a validated	Last updated April 2018 outcome measure be aware that using a single antidepressant rather than combination medication or augmentation (see recommendations to ) is usually associated with a lower side-effect burden consider reintroducing previous treatments that have been inadequately delivered or adhered to, including increasing the dose consider switching to an alternative antidepressant.	When switching to another antidepressant, which can normally be achieved within 1 week when switching from drugs with a short half-life, consider the potential for interactions in determining the choice of new drug and the nature and duration of the transition	When using combinations of medications (which should only normally be started in primary care in consultation with a consultant psychiatrist): select medications that are known to be safe when used together be aware of the increased side-effect burden this usually causes discuss the rationale for any combination with the person with depression, follow	GMC guidance if off-label medication is prescribed, and monitor carefully for adverse effects be familiar with primary evidence and consider obtaining a second opinion when using unusual combinations, the evidence for the efficacy of a chosen strategy is limited or the risk–benefit ratio is unclear document the rationale for the chosen combination.	If a person with depression is informed about, and prepared to tolerate, the increased side-effect burden, consider combining or augmenting an antidepressant with: lithium or an antipsychotic such as aripiprazole , olanzapine , quetiapine or risperidone or another antidepressant such as mirtazapine or mianserin.	When prescribing lithium: monitor renal and thyroid function before treatment and every 6 months during treatment (more often if there is evidence of renal impairment) consider ECG monitoring in people with depression who are at high risk of cardiovascular disease	Combined psychological and drug treatment 0 For a person whose depression has not responded to either pharmacological or psychological interventions, consider combining antidepressant medication with CBT.	Referral 1 For a person whose depression has failed to respond to various strategies for augmentation and combination treatments, consider referral to a practitioner with a specialist interest in treating depression, or to a specialist service.	People who have had multiple episodes of depression, and who have had a good response to treatment with an antidepressant and an augmenting agent, should remain on this combination after remission if they find the side effects tolerable and acceptable	People with depression who are considered to be at significant risk of relapse (including those who have relapsed despite antidepressant treatment or who are unable or choose not to continue antidepressant treatment) or who have residual symptoms, should be offered one of the following psychological interventions: individual CBT for people who have relapsed despite antidepressant medication and for people with a significant history of depression and residual symptoms despite treatment mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for people who are currently well but have experienced three or more previous episodes of depression.	If discontinuation symptoms occur: monitor symptoms and reassure the person if symptoms are mild consider reintroducing the original antidepressant at the dose that was effective (or another antidepressant with a longer half-life from the same class) if symptoms are severe, and reduce the dose gradually while monitoring symptoms. 0 Step 4: complex and severe depression	In specialist mental health services, after thoroughly reviewing previous treatments for depression, consider reintroducing previous treatments that have been inadequately delivered or adhered to.	Consider inpatient treatment for people with depression who are at significant risk of suicide, self-harm or self-neglect.	However, consider increasing the intensity and duration of the interventions and ensure that they can be provided effectively	For people who have depression with psychotic symptoms, consider augmenting the current treatment plan with antipsychotic medication (although the optimum dose and duration of treatment are unknown).	Do not use ECT routinely for people with moderate depression but consider it if their depression has not responded to multiple drug treatments and psychological treatment.

Symptoms should be present for at least 2 weeks and each symptom should be present at sufficient severity for most of every day	Symptoms are considered persistent if they continue despite active monitoring and or low-intensity intervention, or have been present for a considerable time, typically several months (For a diagnosis of dysthymia, symptoms should be present for at least 2 years .)	IV is used in nearly all the evidence reviewed and it provides definitions for atypical symptoms and seasonal depression	In practical terms, clinicians are not expected to switch to DSM-IV but should be aware that the threshold for mild depression is higher than ICD-10 (five symptoms instead of four) and that degree of functional impairment should be routinely assessed before making a diagnosis	Where possible, the key goal of an intervention should be complete relief of symptoms (remission), which is associated with better functioning and a lower likelihood of relapse.	Do not use antidepressants routinely to treat persistent subthreshold depressive symptoms or mild depression because the risk–benefit ratio is poor, but consider them for people with: a past history of moderate or severe depression or initial presentation of subthreshold depressive symptoms that have been present for a long period (typically at least 2 years) or subthreshold depressive symptoms or mild depression that persist(s) after other interventions.

For people with recurrent severe depression or depression with psychotic symptoms and for those who have been treated under the Mental Health Act, consider developing advance decisions and advance statements collaboratively with the person	In addition to assessing symptoms and associated functional impairment, consider how the following factors may have affected the development, course and severity of a person's depression: any history of depression and comorbid mental health or physical disorders any past history of mood elevation (to determine if the depression may be part of bipolar disorder )	Assessment, support, psychoeducation, active monitoring and referral for further assessment and interventions a Complex depression includes depression that shows an inadequate response to multiple treatments, is complicated by psychotic symptoms, and or is associated with significant psychiatric comorbidity or psychosocial factors. b Only for depression where the person also has a chronic physical health problem and associated functional impairment (see depression in adults with a chronic physical health problem: recognition and management NICE clinical guideline 91).	When assessing a person with suspected depression, consider using a validated measure (for example, for symptoms, functions and or disability) to inform and evaluate treatment.	Advise people with depression of the potential for increased agitation, anxiety and suicidal ideation in the initial stages of treatment; actively seek out these symptoms and: ensure that the person knows how to seek help promptly review the person's treatment if they develop marked and or prolonged agitation.	When depression is accompanied by symptoms of anxiety, the first priority should usually be to treat the depression	When the person has an anxiety disorder and comorbid depression or depressive symptoms, consult the NICE guideline for the relevant anxiety disorder (see find guidance) and consider treating the anxiety disorder first (since effective treatment of the anxiety disorder will often improve the depression or the depressive symptoms).	For people with persistent subthreshold depressive symptoms or mild to moderate depression, consider offering one or more of the following interventions, guided by the person's preference: individual guided self-help based on the principles of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) computerised cognitive behavioural therapy (CCBT) a structured group physical activity programme.	Individual guided self-help programmes based on the principles of CBT (and including behavioural activation and problem-solving techniques) for people with persistent subthreshold depressive symptoms or mild to moderate depression should: include the provision of written materials of an appropriate reading age (or alternative media to support access) be supported by a trained practitioner, who typically facilitates the self-help programme and reviews progress and outcome consist of up to six to eight sessions (face-to-face and via telephone) normally taking place over 9 to 12 weeks, including follow-up.	CCBT for people with persistent subthreshold depressive symptoms or mild to moderate depression should: be provided via a stand-alone computer-based or web-based programme include an explanation of the CBT model, encourage tasks between sessions, and use thought-challenging and active monitoring of behaviour, thought patterns and	Physical activity programmes for people with persistent subthreshold depressive symptoms or mild to moderate depression should: be delivered in groups with support from a competent practitioner consist typically of three sessions per week of moderate duration (45 minutes to 1 hour) over 10 to 14 weeks (average 12 weeks).	Consider group-based CBT for people with persistent subthreshold depressive symptoms or mild to moderate depression who decline low-intensity psychosocial interventions (see recommendation ).

For people with depression who decline an antidepressant, CBT, IPT, behavioural activation and behavioural couples therapy, consider: counselling for people with persistent subthreshold depressive symptoms or mild to moderate depression short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy for people with mild to moderate depression.	Discuss antidepressant treatment options with the person with depression, covering: the choice of antidepressant, including any anticipated adverse events, for example side effects and discontinuation symptoms (see recommendation ), and potential interactions with concomitant medication or physical health problems their perception of the efficacy and tolerability of any antidepressants they have previously taken.	When prescribing antidepressants, explore any concerns the person with depression has about taking medication, explain fully the reasons for prescribing, and provide information about taking antidepressants, including: the gradual development of the full antidepressant effect the importance of taking medication as prescribed and the need to continue treatment after remission potential side effects the potential for interactions with other medications the risk and nature of discontinuation symptoms with all antidepressants, particularly with drugs with a shorter half-life (such as paroxetine and venlafaxine), and how these symptoms can be minimised the fact that addiction does not occur with antidepressants.	Last updated April 2018 treatment, provide appropriate information and consider one of the following strategies: monitor symptoms closely where side effects are mild and acceptable to the person or stop the antidepressant or change to a different antidepressant if the person prefers or in discussion with the person, consider short-term concomitant treatment with a benzodiazepine if anxiety, agitation and or insomnia are problematic (except in people with chronic symptoms of anxiety); this should usually be for no longer than 2 weeks in order to prevent the development of dependence.	For all people with persistent subthreshold depressive symptoms or mild to moderate depression having counselling, the duration of treatment should typically be in the range of six to ten sessions over 8 to 12 weeks.

People with depression who are considered to be at significant risk of relapse (including those who have relapsed despite antidepressant treatment or who are unable or choose not to continue antidepressant treatment) or who have residual symptoms, should be offered one of the following psychological interventions: individual CBT for people who have relapsed despite antidepressant medication and for people with a significant history of depression and residual symptoms despite treatment mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for people who are currently well but have experienced three or more previous episodes of depression.	Explain that symptoms are usually mild and self-limiting over about 1 week, but can be severe, particularly if the drug is stopped abruptly.	Inform the person that they should seek advice from their practitioner if they experience significant discontinuation symptoms	If discontinuation symptoms occur: monitor symptoms and reassure the person if symptoms are mild consider reintroducing the original antidepressant at the dose that was effective (or another antidepressant with a longer half-life from the same class) if symptoms are severe, and reduce the dose gradually while monitoring symptoms. 0 Step 4: complex and severe depression	Referral to specialist mental health services should normally be for people with depression who are at significant risk of self-harm, have psychotic symptoms, require complex multiprofessional care, or where an expert opinion on treatment and management is needed.	For people who have depression with psychotic symptoms, consider augmenting the current treatment plan with antipsychotic medication (although the optimum dose and duration of treatment are unknown).

The choice of intervention should be influenced by the: duration of the episode of depression and the trajectory of symptoms previous course of depression and response to treatment likelihood of adherence to treatment and any potential adverse effects person's treatment preference and priorities.	Discuss antidepressant treatment options with the person with depression, covering: the choice of antidepressant, including any anticipated adverse events, for example side effects and discontinuation symptoms (see recommendation ), and potential interactions with concomitant medication or physical health problems their perception of the efficacy and tolerability of any antidepressants they have previously taken.	When prescribing antidepressants, explore any concerns the person with depression has about taking medication, explain fully the reasons for prescribing, and provide information about taking antidepressants, including: the gradual development of the full antidepressant effect the importance of taking medication as prescribed and the need to continue treatment after remission potential side effects the potential for interactions with other medications the risk and nature of discontinuation symptoms with all antidepressants, particularly with drugs with a shorter half-life (such as paroxetine and venlafaxine), and how these symptoms can be minimised the fact that addiction does not occur with antidepressants.	A person with depression started on antidepressants who is considered to present an increased suicide risk or is younger than 30 years (because of the potential increased prevalence of suicidal thoughts in the early stages of antidepressant treatment for this group) should normally be seen after 1 week and frequently thereafter as appropriate until the risk is no longer considered clinically important.	Last updated April 2018 treatment, provide appropriate information and consider one of the following strategies: monitor symptoms closely where side effects are mild and acceptable to the person or stop the antidepressant or change to a different antidepressant if the person prefers or in discussion with the person, consider short-term concomitant treatment with a benzodiazepine if anxiety, agitation and or insomnia are problematic (except in people with chronic symptoms of anxiety); this should usually be for no longer than 2 weeks in order to prevent the development of dependence.	People who start on low-dose TCAs and who have a clear clinical response can be maintained on that dose with careful monitoring. 0 If the person's depression shows no improvement after 2 to 4 weeks with the first antidepressant, check that the drug has been taken regularly and in the prescribed dose. 1 If response is absent or minimal after 3 to 4 weeks of treatment with a therapeutic dose of an antidepressant, increase the level of support (for example, by weekly face-to-face or telephone contact) and consider: increasing the dose in line with the SPC if there are no significant side effects or switching to another antidepressant as described in section if there are side effects or if the person prefers. 2 If the person's depression shows some improvement by 4 weeks, continue treatment for another 2 to 4 weeks	For all high-intensity psychological interventions, the duration of treatment should normally be within the limits indicated in this guideline	For all people with depression having individual CBT, the duration of treatment should typically be in the range of 16 to 20 sessions over 3 to 4 months	Also consider providing: two sessions per week for the first 2 to 3 weeks of treatment for people with moderate or severe depression follow-up sessions typically consisting of three to four sessions over the following 3 to 6 months for all people with depression.	For all people with depression having IPT, the duration of treatment should typically be in the range of 16 to 20 sessions over 3 to 4 months	For people with severe depression, consider providing two sessions per week for the first 2 to 3 weeks of treatment.	For all people with depression having behavioural activation, the duration of treatment should typically be in the range of 16 to 20 sessions over 3 to 4 months	Also consider providing: two sessions per week for the first 3 to 4 weeks of treatment for people with moderate or severe depression follow-up sessions typically consisting of three to four sessions over the following 3 to 6 months for all people with depression.	For all people with persistent subthreshold depressive symptoms or mild to moderate depression having counselling, the duration of treatment should typically be in the range of six to ten sessions over 8 to 12 weeks.	For all people with mild to moderate depression having short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy, the duration of treatment should typically be in the range of 16 to 20 sessions over 4 to 6 months.	For people with long-standing moderate or severe depression who would benefit from additional social or vocational support, consider: befriending as an adjunct to pharmacological or psychological treatments; befriending should be by trained volunteers providing, typically, at least weekly contact for between 2 and 6 months a rehabilitation programme if a person's depression has resulted in loss of work or disengagement from other social activities over a longer term.	When reviewing drug treatment for a person with depression whose symptoms have not adequately responded to initial pharmacological interventions: check adherence to, and side effects from, initial treatment increase the frequency of appointments using outcome monitoring with a validated	Last updated April 2018 outcome measure be aware that using a single antidepressant rather than combination medication or augmentation (see recommendations to ) is usually associated with a lower side-effect burden consider reintroducing previous treatments that have been inadequately delivered or adhered to, including increasing the dose consider switching to an alternative antidepressant.	When prescribing lithium: monitor renal and thyroid function before treatment and every 6 months during treatment (more often if there is evidence of renal impairment) consider ECG monitoring in people with depression who are at high risk of cardiovascular disease	Combined psychological and drug treatment 0 For a person whose depression has not responded to either pharmacological or psychological interventions, consider combining antidepressant medication with CBT.	Referral 1 For a person whose depression has failed to respond to various strategies for augmentation and combination treatments, consider referral to a practitioner with a specialist interest in treating depression, or to a specialist service.	Treatment choice should be influenced by: previous treatment history, including the consequences of a relapse, residual symptoms, response to previous treatment and any discontinuation symptoms the person's preference.	People with depression on long-term maintenance treatment should be	People who have had multiple episodes of depression, and who have had a good response to treatment with an antidepressant and an augmenting agent, should remain on this combination after remission if they find the side effects tolerable and acceptable	People with depression who are considered to be at significant risk of relapse (including those who have relapsed despite antidepressant treatment or who are unable or choose not to continue antidepressant treatment) or who have residual symptoms, should be offered one of the following psychological interventions: individual CBT for people who have relapsed despite antidepressant medication and for people with a significant history of depression and residual symptoms despite treatment mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for people who are currently well but have experienced three or more previous episodes of depression.	For all people with depression who are having individual CBT for relapse prevention, the duration of treatment should typically be in the range of 16 to 20 sessions over 3 to 4 months	If the duration of treatment needs to be extended to achieve remission it should: consist of two sessions per week for the first 2 to 3 weeks of treatment include additional follow-up sessions, typically consisting of four to six sessions over	Last updated April 2018 the following 6 months. 0 Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy should normally be delivered in groups of 8 to 15 participants and consist of weekly 2-hour meetings over 8 weeks and four follow-up sessions in the 12 months after the end of treatment.	Referral to specialist mental health services should normally be for people with depression who are at significant risk of self-harm, have psychotic symptoms, require complex multiprofessional care, or where an expert opinion on treatment and management is needed.	The assessment of a person with depression referred to specialist mental health services should include: their symptom profile, suicide risk and, where appropriate, previous treatment history	In specialist mental health services, after thoroughly reviewing previous treatments for depression, consider reintroducing previous treatments that have been inadequately delivered or adhered to.	Consider inpatient treatment for people with depression who are at significant risk of suicide, self-harm or self-neglect.	For people who have depression with psychotic symptoms, consider augmenting the current treatment plan with antipsychotic medication (although the optimum dose and duration of treatment are unknown).	Do not use ECT routinely for people with moderate depression but consider it if their depression has not responded to multiple drug treatments and psychological treatment.

For people with moderate or severe depression, provide a combination of antidepressant medication and a high-intensity psychological intervention (CBT or IPT).	People with depression who are considered to be at significant risk of relapse (including those who have relapsed despite antidepressant treatment or who are unable or choose not to	Last updated April 2018 continue antidepressant treatment) or who have residual symptoms, should be offered one of the following psychological interventions: individual CBT for people who have relapsed despite antidepressant medication and for people with a significant history of depression and residual symptoms despite treatment mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for people who are currently well but have experienced three or more previous episodes of depression.	When working with people with depression and their families or carers: provide information appropriate to their level of understanding about the nature of depression and the range of treatments available avoid clinical language without adequate explanation ensure that comprehensive written information is available in the appropriate language and in audio format if possible provide and work proficiently with independent interpreters (that is, someone who is not known to the person with depression) if needed.	Inform people with depression about self-help groups, support groups and other local and national resources.

Offer people with depression advice on sleep hygiene if needed, including: establishing regular sleep and wake times avoiding excess eating, smoking or drinking alcohol before sleep creating a proper environment for sleep taking regular physical exercise.	For people with persistent subthreshold depressive symptoms or mild to moderate depression, consider offering one or more of the following interventions, guided by the person's preference: individual guided self-help based on the principles of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) computerised cognitive behavioural therapy (CCBT) a structured group physical activity programme.	Individual guided self-help programmes based on the principles of CBT (and including behavioural activation and problem-solving techniques) for people with persistent subthreshold depressive symptoms or mild to moderate depression should: include the provision of written materials of an appropriate reading age (or alternative media to support access) be supported by a trained practitioner, who typically facilitates the self-help programme and reviews progress and outcome consist of up to six to eight sessions (face-to-face and via telephone) normally taking place over 9 to 12 weeks, including follow-up.	CCBT for people with persistent subthreshold depressive symptoms or mild to moderate depression should: be provided via a stand-alone computer-based or web-based programme include an explanation of the CBT model, encourage tasks between sessions, and use thought-challenging and active monitoring of behaviour, thought patterns and	Physical activity programmes for people with persistent subthreshold depressive symptoms or mild to moderate depression should: be delivered in groups with support from a competent practitioner consist typically of three sessions per week of moderate duration (45 minutes to 1 hour) over 10 to 14 weeks (average 12 weeks).	Consider group-based CBT for people with persistent subthreshold depressive symptoms or mild to moderate depression who decline low-intensity psychosocial interventions (see recommendation ).

Do not use antidepressants routinely to treat persistent subthreshold depressive symptoms or mild depression because the risk–benefit ratio is poor, but consider them for people with: a past history of moderate or severe depression or initial presentation of subthreshold depressive symptoms that have been present for a long period (typically at least 2 years) or	Although there is evidence that St John's wort may be of benefit in mild or moderate depression, practitioners should: not prescribe or advise its use by people with depression because of uncertainty about appropriate doses, persistence of effect, variation in the nature of preparations and potential serious interactions with other drugs (including oral contraceptives, anticoagulants and anticonvulsants) advise people with depression of the different potencies of the preparations available and of the potential serious interactions of St John's wort with other drugs.	For people with persistent subthreshold depressive symptoms or mild to moderate depression who have not benefited from a low-intensity psychosocial intervention, discuss the relative merits of different interventions with the person and provide: an antidepressant (normally a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor SSRI) or a high-intensity psychological intervention, normally one of the following options:	IPT) behavioural couples therapy for people who have a regular partner and where the relationship may contribute to the development or maintenance of depression, or where involving the partner is considered to be of potential therapeutic benefit.	For people with moderate or severe depression, provide a combination of antidepressant medication and a high-intensity psychological intervention (CBT or IPT).	For people with depression who decline an antidepressant, CBT, IPT, behavioural activation and behavioural couples therapy, consider: counselling for people with persistent subthreshold depressive symptoms or mild to moderate depression short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy for people with mild to moderate depression.	In particular, consider prescribing a gastroprotective drug in older people who are taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or aspirin.	For example: the potential for higher doses of venlafaxine to exacerbate cardiac arrhythmias and the need to monitor the person's blood pressure the possible exacerbation of hypertension with venlafaxine and duloxetine the potential for postural hypotension and arrhythmias with TCAs the need for haematological monitoring with mianserin in elderly people.	For people started on antidepressants who are not considered to be at increased risk of suicide, normally see them after 2 weeks	Last updated April 2018 treatment, provide appropriate information and consider one of the following strategies: monitor symptoms closely where side effects are mild and acceptable to the person or stop the antidepressant or change to a different antidepressant if the person prefers or in discussion with the person, consider short-term concomitant treatment with a benzodiazepine if anxiety, agitation and or insomnia are problematic (except in people with chronic symptoms of anxiety); this should usually be for no longer than 2 weeks in order to prevent the development of dependence.	People who start on low-dose TCAs and who have a clear clinical response can be maintained on that dose with careful monitoring. 0 If the person's depression shows no improvement after 2 to 4 weeks with the first antidepressant, check that the drug has been taken regularly and in the prescribed dose. 1 If response is absent or minimal after 3 to 4 weeks of treatment with a therapeutic dose of an antidepressant, increase the level of support (for example, by weekly face-to-face or telephone contact) and consider: increasing the dose in line with the SPC if there are no significant side effects or switching to another antidepressant as described in section if there are side effects or if the person prefers. 2 If the person's depression shows some improvement by 4 weeks, continue treatment for another 2 to 4 weeks	For all people with depression having individual CBT, the duration of treatment should typically be in the range of 16 to 20 sessions over 3 to 4 months	Also consider providing: two sessions per week for the first 2 to 3 weeks of treatment for people with moderate or severe depression follow-up sessions typically consisting of three to four sessions over the following 3 to 6 months for all people with depression.	For all people with depression having IPT, the duration of treatment should typically be in the range of 16 to 20 sessions over 3 to 4 months	For people with severe depression, consider providing two sessions per week for the first 2 to 3 weeks of treatment.	For all people with depression having behavioural activation, the duration of treatment should typically be in the range of 16 to 20 sessions over 3 to 4 months	Also consider providing: two sessions per week for the first 3 to 4 weeks of treatment for people with moderate or severe depression follow-up sessions typically consisting of three to four sessions over the following 3 to 6 months for all people with depression.	For all people with persistent subthreshold depressive symptoms or mild to moderate depression having counselling, the duration of treatment should typically be in the range of six to ten sessions over 8 to 12 weeks.	For all people with mild to moderate depression having short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy, the duration of treatment should typically be in the range of 16 to 20 sessions over 4 to 6 months.	When prescribing antidepressants for older people: prescribe at an age-appropriate dose taking into account the effect of general physical health and concomitant medication on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics	For people with long-standing moderate or severe depression who would benefit from additional social or vocational support, consider: befriending as an adjunct to pharmacological or psychological treatments; befriending should be by trained volunteers providing, typically, at least weekly contact for between 2 and 6 months a rehabilitation programme if a person's depression has resulted in loss of work or disengagement from other social activities over a longer term.	Medication management as a separate intervention for people with depression should not be provided routinely by services	For people with severe depression and those with moderate depression and complex problems, consider: referring to specialist mental health services for a programme of coordinated multiprofessional care providing collaborative care if the depression is in the context of a chronic physical health problem with associated functional impairment .

For all people with depression who are having individual CBT for relapse prevention, the duration of treatment should typically be in the range of 16 to 20 sessions over 3 to 4 months	Referral to specialist mental health services should normally be for people with depression who are at significant risk of self-harm, have psychotic symptoms, require complex multiprofessional care, or where an expert opinion on treatment and management is needed.	The teams should monitor risk as a high-priority routine activity in a way that allows people to continue their lives without disruption.	Teams working with people with complex and severe depression should develop comprehensive multidisciplinary care plans in collaboration with the person with depression (and their family or carer, if agreed with the person)	The care plan should: identify clearly the roles and responsibilities of all health and social care professionals involved develop a crisis plan that identifies potential triggers that could lead to a crisis and strategies to manage such triggers be shared with the GP and the person with depression and other relevant people involved in the person's care.	Consider inpatient treatment for people with depression who are at significant risk of suicide, self-harm or self-neglect.	For people who have depression with psychotic symptoms, consider augmenting the current treatment plan with antipsychotic medication (although the optimum dose and duration of treatment are unknown).	Do not use ECT routinely for people with moderate depression but consider it if their depression has not responded to multiple drug treatments and psychological treatment.
