Last updated April 2018 explore treatment options in an atmosphere of hope and optimism, explaining the different courses of depression and that recovery is possible be aware that stigma and discrimination can be associated with a diagnosis of depression ensure that discussions take place in settings in which confidentiality, privacy and dignity are respected.	When working with people with depression and their families or carers: provide information appropriate to their level of understanding about the nature of depression and the range of treatments available avoid clinical language without adequate explanation ensure that comprehensive written information is available in the appropriate language and in audio format if possible provide and work proficiently with independent interpreters (that is, someone who is not known to the person with depression) if needed.	Inform people with depression about self-help groups, support groups and other local and national resources.	Ensure that consent to treatment is based on the provision of clear information (which should also be available in written form) about the intervention, covering: what it comprises what is expected of the person while having it likely outcomes (including any side effects).	For people with recurrent severe depression or depression with psychotic symptoms and for those who have been treated under the Mental Health Act, consider developing advance decisions and advance statements collaboratively with the person	When families or carers are involved in supporting a person with severe or chronic depression, consider: providing written and verbal information on depression and its management, including how families or carers can support the person offering a carer's assessment of their caring, physical and mental health needs if necessary providing information about local family or carer support groups and voluntary organisations, and helping families or carers to access these negotiating between the person and their family or carer about confidentiality and the sharing of information.	In addition to assessing symptoms and associated functional impairment, consider how the following factors may have affected the development, course and severity of a person's depression: any history of depression and comorbid mental health or physical disorders any past history of mood elevation (to determine if the depression may be part of bipolar disorder )	Be respectful of, and sensitive to, diverse cultural, ethnic and religious backgrounds when working with people with depression, and be aware of the possible variations in the presentation of depression	When providing interventions for people with a learning disability or acquired cognitive impairment who have a diagnosis of depression: where possible, provide the same interventions as for other people with depression if necessary, adjust the method of delivery or duration of the intervention to take account of the disability or impairment.	If there is a risk of self-harm or suicide: assess whether the person has adequate social support and is aware of sources of help arrange help appropriate to the level of risk (see section ) advise the person to seek further help if the situation deteriorates.	Psychological and psychosocial interventions should be based on the relevant treatment manual(s), which should guide the structure and duration of the intervention	Practitioners should consider using competence frameworks developed from the relevant treatment manual(s) and for all interventions should: receive regular high-quality supervision use routine outcome measures and ensure that the person with depression is involved in reviewing the efficacy of the treatment engage in monitoring and evaluation of treatment adherence and practitioner competence – for example, by using video and audio tapes, and external audit and scrutiny where appropriate.	The stepped-care model provides a framework in which to organise the provision of services, and supports patients, carers and practitioners in identifying and accessing the most effective interventions (see figure 1)	In stepped care the least intrusive, most effective intervention is provided first; if a person does not benefit from the intervention initially offered, or declines an intervention, they should be offered an appropriate intervention from the next step.

For people with significant language or communication difficulties, for example people with sensory impairments or a learning disability, consider using the	If a person with depression presents considerable immediate risk to themselves or others, refer them urgently to specialist mental health services.	Advise people with depression of the potential for increased agitation, anxiety and suicidal ideation in the initial stages of treatment; actively seek out these symptoms and: ensure that the person knows how to seek help promptly review the person's treatment if they develop marked and or prolonged agitation.	Advise a person with depression and their family or carer to be vigilant for mood changes, negativity and hopelessness, and suicidal ideation, and to contact their practitioner if concerned	If a person with depression is assessed to be at risk of suicide: take into account toxicity in overdose if an antidepressant is prescribed or the person is taking other medication; if necessary, limit the amount of drug(s) available	Last updated April 2018 consider increasing the level of support, such as more frequent direct or telephone contacts consider referral to specialist mental health services.	When depression is accompanied by symptoms of anxiety, the first priority should usually be to treat the depression	When the person has an anxiety disorder and comorbid depression or depressive symptoms, consult the NICE guideline for the relevant anxiety disorder (see find guidance) and consider treating the anxiety disorder first (since effective treatment of the anxiety disorder will often improve the depression or the depressive symptoms).	Last updated April 2018 provide information about the nature and course of depression arrange a further assessment, normally within 2 weeks make contact if the person does not attend follow-up appointments.	For people with persistent subthreshold depressive symptoms or mild to moderate depression, consider offering one or more of the following interventions, guided by the person's preference: individual guided self-help based on the principles of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) computerised cognitive behavioural therapy (CCBT) a structured group physical activity programme.	Individual guided self-help programmes based on the principles of CBT (and including behavioural activation and problem-solving techniques) for people with persistent subthreshold depressive symptoms or mild to moderate depression should: include the provision of written materials of an appropriate reading age (or alternative media to support access) be supported by a trained practitioner, who typically facilitates the self-help programme and reviews progress and outcome consist of up to six to eight sessions (face-to-face and via telephone) normally taking place over 9 to 12 weeks, including follow-up.	CCBT for people with persistent subthreshold depressive symptoms or mild to moderate depression should: be provided via a stand-alone computer-based or web-based programme include an explanation of the CBT model, encourage tasks between sessions, and use thought-challenging and active monitoring of behaviour, thought patterns and	Last updated April 2018 outcomes be supported by a trained practitioner, who typically provides limited facilitation of the programme and reviews progress and outcome typically take place over 9 to 12 weeks, including follow-up.	Do not use antidepressants routinely to treat persistent subthreshold depressive symptoms or mild depression because the risk–benefit ratio is poor, but consider them for people with: a past history of moderate or severe depression or initial presentation of subthreshold depressive symptoms that have been present for a long period (typically at least 2 years) or	Although there is evidence that St John's wort may be of benefit in mild or moderate depression, practitioners should: not prescribe or advise its use by people with depression because of uncertainty about appropriate doses, persistence of effect, variation in the nature of preparations and potential serious interactions with other drugs (including oral contraceptives, anticoagulants and anticonvulsants) advise people with depression of the different potencies of the preparations available and of the potential serious interactions of St John's wort with other drugs.	For people with persistent subthreshold depressive symptoms or mild to moderate depression who have not benefited from a low-intensity psychosocial intervention, discuss the relative merits of different interventions with the person and provide: an antidepressant (normally a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor SSRI) or a high-intensity psychological intervention, normally one of the following options:	IPT) behavioural couples therapy for people who have a regular partner and where the relationship may contribute to the development or maintenance of depression, or where involving the partner is considered to be of potential therapeutic benefit.	The choice of intervention should be influenced by the: duration of the episode of depression and the trajectory of symptoms previous course of depression and response to treatment likelihood of adherence to treatment and any potential adverse effects person's treatment preference and priorities.	For people with depression who decline an antidepressant, CBT, IPT, behavioural activation and behavioural couples therapy, consider: counselling for people with persistent subthreshold depressive symptoms or mild to moderate depression short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy for people with mild to moderate depression.	Discuss antidepressant treatment options with the person with depression, covering: the choice of antidepressant, including any anticipated adverse events, for example side effects and discontinuation symptoms (see recommendation ), and potential interactions with concomitant medication or physical health problems their perception of the efficacy and tolerability of any antidepressants they have previously taken.	Be aware that: compared with other equally effective antidepressants recommended for routine use in primary care, venlafaxine is associated with a greater risk of death from overdose tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), except for lofepramine, are associated with the greatest risk in overdose.	For example: the potential for higher doses of venlafaxine to exacerbate cardiac arrhythmias and the need to monitor the person's blood pressure the possible exacerbation of hypertension with venlafaxine and duloxetine the potential for postural hypotension and arrhythmias with TCAs the need for haematological monitoring with mianserin in elderly people.	When prescribing antidepressants, explore any concerns the person with depression has about taking medication, explain fully the reasons for prescribing, and provide information about taking antidepressants, including: the gradual development of the full antidepressant effect the importance of taking medication as prescribed and the need to continue treatment after remission potential side effects the potential for interactions with other medications the risk and nature of discontinuation symptoms with all antidepressants, particularly with drugs with a shorter half-life (such as paroxetine and venlafaxine), and how these symptoms can be minimised the fact that addiction does not occur with antidepressants.	For people started on antidepressants who are not considered to be at increased risk of suicide, normally see them after 2 weeks	A person with depression started on antidepressants who is considered to present an increased suicide risk or is younger than 30 years (because of the potential increased prevalence of suicidal thoughts in the early stages of antidepressant treatment for this group) should normally be seen after 1 week and frequently thereafter as appropriate until the risk is no longer considered clinically important.	Last updated April 2018 treatment, provide appropriate information and consider one of the following strategies: monitor symptoms closely where side effects are mild and acceptable to the person or stop the antidepressant or change to a different antidepressant if the person prefers or in discussion with the person, consider short-term concomitant treatment with a benzodiazepine if anxiety, agitation and or insomnia are problematic (except in people with chronic symptoms of anxiety); this should usually be for no longer than 2 weeks in order to prevent the development of dependence.	If the person's depression shows no improvement after 2 to 4 weeks with the first antidepressant, check that the drug has been taken regularly and in the prescribed dose.	If response is absent or minimal after 3 to 4 weeks of treatment with a therapeutic dose of an antidepressant, increase the level of support (for example, by weekly face-to-face or telephone contact) and consider: increasing the dose in line with the SPC if there are no significant side effects or switching to another antidepressant as described in section if there are side effects or if the person prefers.	For all high-intensity psychological interventions, the duration of treatment should normally be within the limits indicated in this guideline	For all people with depression having individual CBT, the duration of treatment should typically be in the range of 16 to 20 sessions over 3 to 4 months	Also consider providing: two sessions per week for the first 2 to 3 weeks of treatment for people with moderate or severe depression follow-up sessions typically consisting of three to four sessions over the following 3 to 6 months for all people with depression.	For all people with depression having IPT, the duration of treatment should typically be in the range of 16 to 20 sessions over 3 to 4 months	For people with severe depression, consider providing two sessions per week for the first 2 to 3 weeks of treatment.	For all people with depression having behavioural activation, the duration of treatment should typically be in the range of 16 to 20 sessions over 3 to 4 months	Also consider providing: two sessions per week for the first 3 to 4 weeks of treatment for people with moderate or severe depression follow-up sessions typically consisting of three to four sessions over the following 3 to 6 months for all people with depression.	Behavioural couples therapy for depression should normally be based on behavioural principles, and an adequate course of therapy should be 15 to 20 sessions over 5 to 6 months.	For all people with persistent subthreshold depressive symptoms or mild to moderate depression having counselling, the duration of treatment should typically be in the range of six to ten sessions over 8 to 12 weeks.	For all people with mild to moderate depression having short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy, the duration of treatment should typically be in the range of 16 to 20 sessions over 4 to 6 months.	Refer to 'Depression in adults with a chronic physical health problem: recognition and management' (NICE clinical guideline 91) for further information.	When prescribing antidepressants for older people: prescribe at an age-appropriate dose taking into account the effect of general physical health and concomitant medication on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics	For people with long-standing moderate or severe depression who would benefit from additional social or vocational support, consider: befriending as an adjunct to pharmacological or psychological treatments; befriending should be by trained volunteers providing, typically, at least weekly contact for between 2 and 6 months a rehabilitation programme if a person's depression has resulted in loss of work or disengagement from other social activities over a longer term.	For people with severe depression and those with moderate depression and complex problems, consider: referring to specialist mental health services for a programme of coordinated multiprofessional care providing collaborative care if the depression is in the context of a chronic physical health problem with associated functional impairment .	When reviewing drug treatment for a person with depression whose symptoms have not adequately responded to initial pharmacological interventions: check adherence to, and side effects from, initial treatment increase the frequency of appointments using outcome monitoring with a validated	Last updated April 2018 outcome measure be aware that using a single antidepressant rather than combination medication or augmentation (see recommendations to ) is usually associated with a lower side-effect burden consider reintroducing previous treatments that have been inadequately delivered or adhered to, including increasing the dose consider switching to an alternative antidepressant.	When switching to another antidepressant, be aware that the evidence for the relative advantage of switching either within or between classes is weak.	When switching to another antidepressant, which can normally be achieved within 1 week when switching from drugs with a short half-life, consider the potential for interactions in determining the choice of new drug and the nature and duration of the transition	Last updated April 2018 from a non-reversible MAOI: a 2-week washout period is required (other antidepressants should not be prescribed routinely during this period).	When using combinations of medications (which should only normally be started in primary care in consultation with a consultant psychiatrist): select medications that are known to be safe when used together be aware of the increased side-effect burden this usually causes discuss the rationale for any combination with the person with depression, follow	GMC guidance if off-label medication is prescribed, and monitor carefully for adverse effects be familiar with primary evidence and consider obtaining a second opinion when using unusual combinations, the evidence for the efficacy of a chosen strategy is limited or the risk–benefit ratio is unclear document the rationale for the chosen combination.	If a person with depression is informed about, and prepared to tolerate, the increased side-effect burden, consider combining or augmenting an antidepressant with: lithium or an antipsychotic such as aripiprazole , olanzapine , quetiapine or risperidone or another antidepressant such as mirtazapine or mianserin.	When prescribing lithium: monitor renal and thyroid function before treatment and every 6 months during treatment (more often if there is evidence of renal impairment) consider ECG monitoring in people with depression who are at high risk of cardiovascular disease	The following strategies should not be used routinely: augmentation of an antidepressant with a benzodiazepine for more than 2 weeks as there is a risk of dependence augmentation of an antidepressant with buspirone , carbamazepine , lamotrigine or valproate as there is insufficient evidence for their use augmentation of an antidepressant with pindolol or thyroid hormones as there is inconsistent evidence of effectiveness .	For a person whose depression has not responded to either pharmacological or psychological interventions, consider combining antidepressant medication with CBT.	Treatment choice should be influenced by: previous treatment history, including the consequences of a relapse, residual symptoms, response to previous treatment and any discontinuation symptoms the person's preference.	People who have had multiple episodes of depression, and who have had a good response to treatment with an antidepressant and an augmenting agent, should remain on this combination after remission if they find the side effects tolerable and acceptable	If one medication is stopped, it should usually be the augmenting agent	People with depression who are considered to be at significant risk of relapse (including those who have relapsed despite antidepressant treatment or who are unable or choose not to continue antidepressant treatment) or who have residual symptoms, should be offered one of the following psychological interventions: individual CBT for people who have relapsed despite antidepressant medication and for people with a significant history of depression and residual symptoms despite treatment mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for people who are currently well but have experienced three or more previous episodes of depression.	For all people with depression who are having individual CBT for relapse prevention, the duration of treatment should typically be in the range of 16 to 20 sessions over 3 to 4 months	If the duration of treatment needs to be extended to achieve remission it should: consist of two sessions per week for the first 2 to 3 weeks of treatment include additional follow-up sessions, typically consisting of four to six sessions over	Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy should normally be delivered in groups of 8 to 15 participants and consist of weekly 2-hour meetings over 8 weeks and four follow-up sessions in the 12 months after the end of treatment.	Explain that symptoms are usually mild and self-limiting over about 1 week, but can be severe, particularly if the drug is stopped abruptly.	Inform the person that they should seek advice from their practitioner if they experience significant discontinuation symptoms	If discontinuation symptoms occur: monitor symptoms and reassure the person if symptoms are mild consider reintroducing the original antidepressant at the dose that was effective (or another antidepressant with a longer half-life from the same class) if symptoms are severe, and reduce the dose gradually while monitoring symptoms.	The assessment of a person with depression referred to specialist mental health services should include: their symptom profile, suicide risk and, where appropriate, previous treatment history	The teams should monitor risk as a high-priority routine activity in a way that allows people to continue their lives without disruption.	Medication in secondary care mental health services should be started under the supervision of a consultant psychiatrist.	Teams working with people with complex and severe depression should develop comprehensive multidisciplinary care plans in collaboration with the person with depression (and their family or carer, if agreed with the person)	The care plan should: identify clearly the roles and responsibilities of all health and social care professionals involved develop a crisis plan that identifies potential triggers that could lead to a crisis and strategies to manage such triggers be shared with the GP and the person with depression and other relevant people involved in the person's care.	The full range of high-intensity psychological interventions should normally be offered in inpatient settings	However, consider increasing the intensity and duration of the interventions and ensure that they can be provided effectively	For people who have depression with psychotic symptoms, consider augmenting the current treatment plan with antipsychotic medication (although the optimum dose and duration of treatment are unknown).	The recommendations in this section update the depression aspects only of 'Guidance on the use of electroconvulsive therapy' (NICE technology appraisal guidance 59).	Do not use ECT routinely for people with moderate depression but consider it if their depression has not responded to multiple drug treatments and psychological treatment.	ECT, consider a repeat trial of ECT only after: reviewing the adequacy of the previous treatment course and considering all other options and discussing the risks and benefits with the person and or, where appropriate, their advocate or carer.	When considering ECT as a treatment choice, ensure that the person with depression is fully informed of the risks associated with ECT, and with the risks and benefits specific to them	Document the assessment and consider: the risks associated with a general anaesthetic	The risks associated with ECT may be greater in older people; exercise particular caution when considering ECT trea	The effectiveness of maintenance ECT for relapse prevention in people with severe and recurring	MHRA advice on valproate: In April 2018, we added warnings that valproate must not be used in pregnancy, and only used in girls and women when there is no alternative and a pregnancy prevention plan is in place	The update information section has a list of recommendations for which the evidence has not been updated since the original guideline.	This guideline is published alongside 'Depression in adults with a chronic physical health problem: recognition and management' (NICE clinical guideline 91) which makes recommendations on the identification treatment and management of depression in adults aged 18 years and older who also have a chronic physical health problem.	This guideline makes recommendations on the identification, treatment and management of depression in adults aged 18 years and older, in primary and secondary care	This guideline covers people whose depression occurs as the primary diagnosis; the relevant NICE guidelines should be consulted for depression occurring in the context of other disorders (see our topic page on depression).	Symptoms are considered persistent if they continue despite active monitoring and or low-intensity intervention, or have been present for a considerable time, typically several months (For a diagnosis of dysthymia, symptoms should be present for at least 2 years .)	It should be noted that classificatory systems are agreed conventions that seek to define different severities of depression in order to guide diagnosis and treatment, and their value is determined by how useful they are in practice	After careful review of the diagnostic criteria and the evidence, the	IV is used in nearly all the evidence reviewed and it provides definitions for atypical symptoms and seasonal depression	In practical terms, clinicians are not expected to switch to DSM-IV but should be aware that the threshold for mild depression is higher than ICD-10 (five symptoms instead of four) and that degree of functional impairment should be routinely assessed before making a diagnosis	Therefore it is also important to consider both personal past history and family history of depression when undertaking a diagnostic assessment (see appendix for further details).	Where possible, the key goal of an intervention should be complete relief of symptoms (remission), which is associated with better functioning and a lower likelihood of relapse.	The guideline assumes that prescribers will use a drug's summary of product characteristics (SPC) and the 'British national formulary' (BNF) to inform their decisions made with individual patients.	This guideline recommends some drugs for indications for which they do not have a UK marketing authorisation at the date of publication, if they are already in use in the NHS for that indication, and there is good evidence to support that use	UK marketing authorisation for depression or the indication stated at the time of publication.

When prescribing antidepressants, explore any concerns the person with depression has about taking medication, explain fully the reasons for prescribing, and provide information about taking antidepressants, including: the gradual development of the full antidepressant effect the importance of taking medication as prescribed and the need to continue treatment after remission potential side effects the potential for interactions with other medications the risk and nature of discontinuation symptoms with all antidepressants, particularly with drugs with a shorter half-life (such as paroxetine and venlafaxine), and how these symptoms can be minimised the fact that addiction does not occur with antidepressants.	For people started on antidepressants who are not considered to be at increased risk of suicide, normally see them after 2 weeks	A person with depression started on antidepressants who is considered to present an increased suicide risk or is younger than 30 years (because of the potential increased prevalence of suicidal thoughts in the early stages of antidepressant treatment for this group) should normally be seen after 1 week and frequently thereafter as appropriate until the risk is no longer considered clinically important.	Last updated April 2018 treatment, provide appropriate information and consider one of the following strategies: monitor symptoms closely where side effects are mild and acceptable to the person or stop the antidepressant or change to a different antidepressant if the person prefers or in discussion with the person, consider short-term concomitant treatment with a benzodiazepine if anxiety, agitation and or insomnia are problematic (except in people with chronic symptoms of anxiety); this should usually be for no longer than 2 weeks in order to prevent the development of dependence.	If the person's depression shows no improvement after 2 to 4 weeks with the first antidepressant, check that the drug has been taken regularly and in the prescribed dose.	If response is absent or minimal after 3 to 4 weeks of treatment with a therapeutic dose of an antidepressant, increase the level of support (for example, by weekly face-to-face or telephone contact) and consider: increasing the dose in line with the SPC if there are no significant side effects or switching to another antidepressant as described in section if there are side effects or if the person prefers.	For all high-intensity psychological interventions, the duration of treatment should normally be within the limits indicated in this guideline	For all people with depression having individual CBT, the duration of treatment should typically be in the range of 16 to 20 sessions over 3 to 4 months	Also consider providing: two sessions per week for the first 2 to 3 weeks of treatment for people with moderate or severe depression follow-up sessions typically consisting of three to four sessions over the following 3 to 6 months for all people with depression.	For all people with depression having IPT, the duration of treatment should typically be in the range of 16 to 20 sessions over 3 to 4 months	For people with severe depression, consider providing two sessions per week for the first 2 to 3 weeks of treatment.	For all people with depression having behavioural activation, the duration of treatment should typically be in the range of 16 to 20 sessions over 3 to 4 months	Also consider providing: two sessions per week for the first 3 to 4 weeks of treatment for people with moderate or severe depression follow-up sessions typically consisting of three to four sessions over the following 3 to 6 months for all people with depression.	Behavioural couples therapy for depression should normally be based on behavioural principles, and an adequate course of therapy should be 15 to 20 sessions over 5 to 6 months.	For all people with persistent subthreshold depressive symptoms or mild to moderate depression having counselling, the duration of treatment should typically be in the range of six to ten sessions over 8 to 12 weeks.	For all people with mild to moderate depression having short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy, the duration of treatment should typically be in the range of 16 to 20 sessions over 4 to 6 months.	Refer to 'Depression in adults with a chronic physical health problem: recognition and management' (NICE clinical guideline 91) for further information.	When prescribing antidepressants for older people: prescribe at an age-appropriate dose taking into account the effect of general physical health and concomitant medication on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics	For people with long-standing moderate or severe depression who would benefit from additional social or vocational support, consider: befriending as an adjunct to pharmacological or psychological treatments; befriending should be by trained volunteers providing, typically, at least weekly contact for between 2 and 6 months a rehabilitation programme if a person's depression has resulted in loss of work or disengagement from other social activities over a longer term.	For people with severe depression and those with moderate depression and complex problems, consider: referring to specialist mental health services for a programme of coordinated multiprofessional care providing collaborative care if the depression is in the context of a chronic physical health problem with associated functional impairment .	When reviewing drug treatment for a person with depression whose symptoms have not adequately responded to initial pharmacological interventions: check adherence to, and side effects from, initial treatment increase the frequency of appointments using outcome monitoring with a validated	Last updated April 2018 outcome measure be aware that using a single antidepressant rather than combination medication or augmentation (see recommendations to ) is usually associated with a lower side-effect burden consider reintroducing previous treatments that have been inadequately delivered or adhered to, including increasing the dose consider switching to an alternative antidepressant.	When switching to another antidepressant, be aware that the evidence for the relative advantage of switching either within or between classes is weak.	When switching to another antidepressant, which can normally be achieved within 1 week when switching from drugs with a short half-life, consider the potential for interactions in determining the choice of new drug and the nature and duration of the transition	Last updated April 2018 from a non-reversible MAOI: a 2-week washout period is required (other antidepressants should not be prescribed routinely during this period).	When using combinations of medications (which should only normally be started in primary care in consultation with a consultant psychiatrist): select medications that are known to be safe when used together be aware of the increased side-effect burden this usually causes discuss the rationale for any combination with the person with depression, follow	GMC guidance if off-label medication is prescribed, and monitor carefully for adverse effects be familiar with primary evidence and consider obtaining a second opinion when using unusual combinations, the evidence for the efficacy of a chosen strategy is limited or the risk–benefit ratio is unclear document the rationale for the chosen combination.	If a person with depression is informed about, and prepared to tolerate, the increased side-effect burden, consider combining or augmenting an antidepressant with: lithium or an antipsychotic such as aripiprazole , olanzapine , quetiapine or risperidone or another antidepressant such as mirtazapine or mianserin.	When prescribing lithium: monitor renal and thyroid function before treatment and every 6 months during treatment (more often if there is evidence of renal impairment) consider ECG monitoring in people with depression who are at high risk of cardiovascular disease	The following strategies should not be used routinely: augmentation of an antidepressant with a benzodiazepine for more than 2 weeks as there is a risk of dependence augmentation of an antidepressant with buspirone , carbamazepine , lamotrigine or valproate as there is insufficient evidence for their use augmentation of an antidepressant with pindolol or thyroid hormones as there is inconsistent evidence of effectiveness .	For a person whose depression has not responded to either pharmacological or psychological interventions, consider combining antidepressant medication with CBT.	Treatment choice should be influenced by: previous treatment history, including the consequences of a relapse, residual symptoms, response to previous treatment and any discontinuation symptoms the person's preference.	People who have had multiple episodes of depression, and who have had a good response to treatment with an antidepressant and an augmenting agent, should remain on this combination after remission if they find the side effects tolerable and acceptable	If one medication is stopped, it should usually be the augmenting agent	People with depression who are considered to be at significant risk of relapse (including those who have relapsed despite antidepressant treatment or who are unable or choose not to continue antidepressant treatment) or who have residual symptoms, should be offered one of the following psychological interventions: individual CBT for people who have relapsed despite antidepressant medication and for people with a significant history of depression and residual symptoms despite treatment mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for people who are currently well but have experienced three or more previous episodes of depression.	For all people with depression who are having individual CBT for relapse prevention, the duration of treatment should typically be in the range of 16 to 20 sessions over 3 to 4 months	If the duration of treatment needs to be extended to achieve remission it should: consist of two sessions per week for the first 2 to 3 weeks of treatment include additional follow-up sessions, typically consisting of four to six sessions over	Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy should normally be delivered in groups of 8 to 15 participants and consist of weekly 2-hour meetings over 8 weeks and four follow-up sessions in the 12 months after the end of treatment.	Explain that symptoms are usually mild and self-limiting over about 1 week, but can be severe, particularly if the drug is stopped abruptly.	Inform the person that they should seek advice from their practitioner if they experience significant discontinuation symptoms	If discontinuation symptoms occur: monitor symptoms and reassure the person if symptoms are mild consider reintroducing the original antidepressant at the dose that was effective (or another antidepressant with a longer half-life from the same class) if symptoms are severe, and reduce the dose gradually while monitoring symptoms.	The assessment of a person with depression referred to specialist mental health services should include: their symptom profile, suicide risk and, where appropriate, previous treatment history	The teams should monitor risk as a high-priority routine activity in a way that allows people to continue their lives without disruption.	Medication in secondary care mental health services should be started under the supervision of a consultant psychiatrist.	Teams working with people with complex and severe depression should develop comprehensive multidisciplinary care plans in collaboration with the person with depression (and their family or carer, if agreed with the person)	The care plan should: identify clearly the roles and responsibilities of all health and social care professionals involved develop a crisis plan that identifies potential triggers that could lead to a crisis and strategies to manage such triggers be shared with the GP and the person with depression and other relevant people involved in the person's care.	The full range of high-intensity psychological interventions should normally be offered in inpatient settings	However, consider increasing the intensity and duration of the interventions and ensure that they can be provided effectively	For people who have depression with psychotic symptoms, consider augmenting the current treatment plan with antipsychotic medication (although the optimum dose and duration of treatment are unknown).	The recommendations in this section update the depression aspects only of 'Guidance on the use of electroconvulsive therapy' (NICE technology appraisal guidance 59).	Do not use ECT routinely for people with moderate depression but consider it if their depression has not responded to multiple drug treatments and psychological treatment.	ECT, consider a repeat trial of ECT only after: reviewing the adequacy of the previous treatment course and considering all other options and discussing the risks and benefits with the person and or, where appropriate, their advocate or carer.	When considering ECT as a treatment choice, ensure that the person with depression is fully informed of the risks associated with ECT, and with the risks and benefits specific to them	Document the assessment and consider: the risks associated with a general anaesthetic	The risks associated with ECT may be greater in older people; exercise particular caution when considering ECT trea

This guideline makes recommendations on the identification, treatment and management of depression in adults aged 18 years and older, in primary and secondary care	This guideline covers people whose depression occurs as the primary diagnosis; the relevant NICE guidelines should be consulted for depression occurring in the context of other disorders (see our topic page on depression).	The guideline assumes that prescribers will use a drug's summary of product characteristics (SPC) and the 'British national formulary' (BNF) to inform their decisions made with individual patients.	This guideline recommends some drugs for indications for which they do not have a UK marketing authorisation at the date of publication, if they are already in use in the NHS for that indication, and there is good evidence to support that use	Section of this guideline updates recommendations made in 'Guidance on the use of electroconvulsive therapy' (NICE technology appraisal guidance 59) for the treatment of depression only	Recommendation of this guideline updates recommendations made in 'Computerised cognitive behaviour therapy for depression and anxiety' (NICE technology appraisal guidance 97) for the treatment of depression only	This guideline is published alongside 'Depression in adults with a chronic physical health problem: recognition and management' (NICE clinical guideline 91), which makes recommendations on the identification, treatment and management of depression in adults aged 18 years and older who also have a chronic physical health problem.	Making decisions using NICE guidelines explains how we use words to show the strength (or certainty) of our recommendations, and has information about prescribing medicines (including off-label use), professional guidelines, standards and laws (including on consent and mental capacity), and safeguarding.	In stepped care the least intrusive, most effective intervention is provided first; if a person does not benefit from the intervention initially offered, or declines an intervention, they should be offered an appropriate intervention from the next step.	Assessment, support, psychoeducation, active monitoring and referral for further assessment and interventions a Complex depression includes depression that shows an inadequate response to multiple treatments, is complicated by psychotic symptoms, and or is associated with significant psychiatric comorbidity or psychosocial factors. b Only for depression where the person also has a chronic physical health problem and associated functional impairment (see depression in adults with a chronic physical health problem: recognition and management NICE clinical guideline 91).	When the person has an anxiety disorder and comorbid depression or depressive symptoms, consult the NICE guideline for the relevant anxiety disorder (see find guidance) and consider treating the anxiety disorder first (since effective treatment of the anxiety disorder will often improve the depression or the depressive symptoms).	Consider group-based CBT for people with persistent subthreshold depressive symptoms or mild to moderate depression who decline low-intensity psychosocial interventions (see recommendation ).	For people with depression who decline an antidepressant, CBT, IPT, behavioural activation and behavioural couples therapy, consider: counselling for people with persistent subthreshold depressive symptoms or mild to moderate depression short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy for people with mild to moderate depression.	If response is absent or minimal after 3 to 4 weeks of treatment with a therapeutic dose of an antidepressant, increase the level of support (for example, by weekly face-to-face or telephone contact) and consider: increasing the dose in line with the SPC if there are no significant side effects or switching to another antidepressant as described in section if there are side effects or if the person prefers.	For all high-intensity psychological interventions, the duration of treatment should normally be within the limits indicated in this guideline	Refer to 'Depression in adults with a chronic physical health problem: recognition and management' (NICE clinical guideline 91) for further information.

When assessing a person with suspected depression, be aware of any learning disabilities or acquired cognitive impairments, and if necessary consider consulting with a relevant specialist when developing treatment plans and strategies.	When providing interventions for people with a learning disability or acquired cognitive impairment who have a diagnosis of depression: where possible, provide the same interventions as for other people with depression if necessary, adjust the method of delivery or duration of the intervention to take account of the disability or impairment.

For people with long-standing moderate or severe depression who would benefit from additional social or vocational support, consider: befriending as an adjunct to pharmacological or psychological treatments; befriending should be by trained volunteers providing, typically, at least weekly contact for between 2 and 6 months a rehabilitation programme if a person's depression has resulted in loss of work or disengagement from other social activities over a longer term.	It is likely to be effective only when provided as part of a more complex intervention.

Do not use antidepressants routinely to treat persistent subthreshold depressive symptoms or mild depression because the risk–benefit ratio is poor, but consider them for people with: a past history of moderate or severe depression or initial presentation of subthreshold depressive symptoms that have been present for a long period (typically at least 2 years) or	Although there is evidence that St John's wort may be of benefit in mild or moderate depression, practitioners should: not prescribe or advise its use by people with depression because of uncertainty about appropriate doses, persistence of effect, variation in the nature of preparations and potential serious interactions with other drugs (including oral contraceptives, anticoagulants and anticonvulsants) advise people with depression of the different potencies of the preparations available and of the potential serious interactions of St John's wort with other drugs.	For people with persistent subthreshold depressive symptoms or mild to moderate depression who have not benefited from a low-intensity psychosocial intervention, discuss the relative merits of different interventions with the person and provide: an antidepressant (normally a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor SSRI) or a high-intensity psychological intervention, normally one of the following options:	For people with depression who decline an antidepressant, CBT, IPT, behavioural activation and behavioural couples therapy, consider: counselling for people with persistent subthreshold depressive symptoms or mild to moderate depression short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy for people with mild to moderate depression.	In particular, consider prescribing a gastroprotective drug in older people who are taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or aspirin.	Be aware that: compared with other equally effective antidepressants recommended for routine use in primary care, venlafaxine is associated with a greater risk of death from overdose tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), except for lofepramine, are associated with the greatest risk in overdose.	For all people with depression having individual CBT, the duration of treatment should typically be in the range of 16 to 20 sessions over 3 to 4 months	For all people with depression having behavioural activation, the duration of treatment should typically be in the range of 16 to 20 sessions over 3 to 4 months	For all people with persistent subthreshold depressive symptoms or mild to moderate depression having counselling, the duration of treatment should typically be in the range of six to ten sessions over 8 to 12 weeks.	For people with long-standing moderate or severe depression who would benefit from additional social or vocational support, consider: befriending as an adjunct to pharmacological or psychological treatments; befriending should be by trained volunteers providing, typically, at least weekly contact for between 2 and 6 months a rehabilitation programme if a person's depression has resulted in loss of work or disengagement from other social activities over a longer term.	It is likely to be effective only when provided as part of a more complex intervention.	For people with severe depression and those with moderate depression and complex problems, consider: referring to specialist mental health services for a programme of coordinated multiprofessional care providing collaborative care if the depression is in the context of a chronic physical health problem with associated functional impairment .	Last updated April 2018 outcome measure be aware that using a single antidepressant rather than combination medication or augmentation (see recommendations to ) is usually associated with a lower side-effect burden consider reintroducing previous treatments that have been inadequately delivered or adhered to, including increasing the dose consider switching to an alternative antidepressant.	When switching to another antidepressant, be aware that the evidence for the relative advantage of switching either within or between classes is weak.	The following strategies should not be used routinely: augmentation of an antidepressant with a benzodiazepine for more than 2 weeks as there is a risk of dependence augmentation of an antidepressant with buspirone , carbamazepine , lamotrigine or valproate as there is insufficient evidence for their use augmentation of an antidepressant with pindolol or thyroid hormones as there is inconsistent evidence of effectiveness .	People with depression who are considered to be at significant risk of relapse (including those who have relapsed despite antidepressant treatment or who are unable or choose not to continue antidepressant treatment) or who have residual symptoms, should be offered one of the following psychological interventions: individual CBT for people who have relapsed despite antidepressant medication and for people with a significant history of depression and residual symptoms despite treatment mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for people who are currently well but have experienced three or more previous episodes of depression.	Delivering psychological interventions for relapse prevention	For all people with depression who are having individual CBT for relapse prevention, the duration of treatment should typically be in the range of 16 to 20 sessions over 3 to 4 months	Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy should normally be delivered in groups of 8 to 15 participants and consist of weekly 2-hour meetings over 8 weeks and four follow-up sessions in the 12 months after the end of treatment.	If discontinuation symptoms occur: monitor symptoms and reassure the person if symptoms are mild consider reintroducing the original antidepressant at the dose that was effective (or another antidepressant with a longer half-life from the same class) if symptoms are severe, and reduce the dose gradually while monitoring symptoms.	In specialist mental health services, after thoroughly reviewing previous treatments for depression, consider reintroducing previous treatments that have been inadequately delivered or adhered to.	The teams should monitor risk as a high-priority routine activity in a way that allows people to continue their lives without disruption.	Teams working with people with complex and severe depression should develop comprehensive multidisciplinary care plans in collaboration with the person with depression (and their family or carer, if agreed with the person)	However, consider increasing the intensity and duration of the interventions and ensure that they can be provided effectively	The recommendations in this section update the depression aspects only of 'Guidance on the use of electroconvulsive therapy' (NICE technology appraisal guidance 59).

When prescribing antidepressants, explore any concerns the person with depression has about taking medication, explain fully the reasons for prescribing, and provide information about taking antidepressants, including: the gradual development of the full antidepressant effect the importance of taking medication as prescribed and the need to continue treatment after remission potential side effects the potential for interactions with other medications the risk and nature of discontinuation symptoms with all antidepressants, particularly with drugs with a shorter half-life (such as paroxetine and venlafaxine), and how these symptoms can be minimised the fact that addiction does not occur with antidepressants.

When working with people with depression and their families or carers: provide information appropriate to their level of understanding about the nature of depression and the range of treatments available avoid clinical language without adequate explanation ensure that comprehensive written information is available in the appropriate language and in audio format if possible provide and work proficiently with independent interpreters (that is, someone who is not known to the person with depression) if needed.	Ensure that consent to treatment is based on the provision of clear information (which should also be available in written form) about the intervention, covering: what it comprises what is expected of the person while having it likely outcomes (including any side effects).	Principles for assessment, coordination of care and choosing treatments	Ensure competence in: culturally sensitive assessment using different explanatory models of depression addressing cultural and ethnic differences when developing and implementing treatment plans working with families from diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds.	When assessing a person with suspected depression, be aware of any learning disabilities or acquired cognitive impairments, and if necessary consider consulting with a relevant specialist when developing treatment plans and strategies.	Psychological and psychosocial interventions should be based on the relevant treatment manual(s), which should guide the structure and duration of the intervention	Practitioners should consider using competence frameworks developed from the relevant treatment manual(s) and for all interventions should: receive regular high-quality supervision use routine outcome measures and ensure that the person with depression is involved in reviewing the efficacy of the treatment engage in monitoring and evaluation of treatment adherence and practitioner competence – for example, by using video and audio tapes, and external audit and scrutiny where appropriate.	Medication, high-intensity psychological interventions, combined treatments, collaborative careb and referral for further assessment and interventions	Assessment, support, psychoeducation, active monitoring and referral for further assessment and interventions a Complex depression includes depression that shows an inadequate response to multiple treatments, is complicated by psychotic symptoms, and or is associated with significant psychiatric comorbidity or psychosocial factors. b Only for depression where the person also has a chronic physical health problem and associated functional impairment (see depression in adults with a chronic physical health problem: recognition and management NICE clinical guideline 91).	When assessing a person with suspected depression, consider using a validated measure (for example, for symptoms, functions and or disability) to inform and evaluate treatment.	Advise people with depression of the potential for increased agitation, anxiety and suicidal ideation in the initial stages of treatment; actively seek out these symptoms and: ensure that the person knows how to seek help promptly review the person's treatment if they develop marked and or prolonged agitation.	When the person has an anxiety disorder and comorbid depression or depressive symptoms, consult the NICE guideline for the relevant anxiety disorder (see find guidance) and consider treating the anxiety disorder first (since effective treatment of the anxiety disorder will often improve the depression or the depressive symptoms).	The choice of intervention should be influenced by the: duration of the episode of depression and the trajectory of symptoms previous course of depression and response to treatment likelihood of adherence to treatment and any potential adverse effects person's treatment preference and priorities.	Discuss antidepressant treatment options with the person with depression, covering: the choice of antidepressant, including any anticipated adverse events, for example side effects and discontinuation symptoms (see recommendation ), and potential interactions with concomitant medication or physical health problems their perception of the efficacy and tolerability of any antidepressants they have previously taken.	When prescribing antidepressants, explore any concerns the person with depression has about taking medication, explain fully the reasons for prescribing, and provide information about taking antidepressants, including: the gradual development of the full antidepressant effect the importance of taking medication as prescribed and the need to continue treatment after remission potential side effects the potential for interactions with other medications the risk and nature of discontinuation symptoms with all antidepressants, particularly with drugs with a shorter half-life (such as paroxetine and venlafaxine), and how these symptoms can be minimised the fact that addiction does not occur with antidepressants.	A person with depression started on antidepressants who is considered to present an increased suicide risk or is younger than 30 years (because of the potential increased prevalence of suicidal thoughts in the early stages of antidepressant treatment for this group) should normally be seen after 1 week and frequently thereafter as appropriate until the risk is no longer considered clinically important.	Last updated April 2018 treatment, provide appropriate information and consider one of the following strategies: monitor symptoms closely where side effects are mild and acceptable to the person or stop the antidepressant or change to a different antidepressant if the person prefers or in discussion with the person, consider short-term concomitant treatment with a benzodiazepine if anxiety, agitation and or insomnia are problematic (except in people with chronic symptoms of anxiety); this should usually be for no longer than 2 weeks in order to prevent the development of dependence.	If response is absent or minimal after 3 to 4 weeks of treatment with a therapeutic dose of an antidepressant, increase the level of support (for example, by weekly face-to-face or telephone contact) and consider: increasing the dose in line with the SPC if there are no significant side effects or switching to another antidepressant as described in section if there are side effects or if the person prefers.	For all high-intensity psychological interventions, the duration of treatment should normally be within the limits indicated in this guideline	For all people with depression having individual CBT, the duration of treatment should typically be in the range of 16 to 20 sessions over 3 to 4 months	Also consider providing: two sessions per week for the first 2 to 3 weeks of treatment for people with moderate or severe depression follow-up sessions typically consisting of three to four sessions over the following 3 to 6 months for all people with depression.	For all people with depression having IPT, the duration of treatment should typically be in the range of 16 to 20 sessions over 3 to 4 months	For people with severe depression, consider providing two sessions per week for the first 2 to 3 weeks of treatment.

For all people with mild to moderate depression having short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy, the duration of treatment should typically be in the range of 16 to 20 sessions over 4 to 6 months.	For people with long-standing moderate or severe depression who would benefit from additional social or vocational support, consider: befriending as an adjunct to pharmacological or psychological treatments; befriending should be by trained volunteers providing, typically, at least weekly contact for between 2 and 6 months a rehabilitation programme if a person's depression has resulted in loss of work or disengagement from other social activities over a longer term.

Referral to specialist mental health services should normally be for people with depression who are at significant risk of self-harm, have psychotic symptoms, require complex multiprofessional care, or where an expert opinion on treatment and management is needed.	The assessment of a person with depression referred to specialist mental health services should include: their symptom profile, suicide risk and, where appropriate, previous treatment history	In specialist mental health services, after thoroughly reviewing previous treatments for depression, consider reintroducing previous treatments that have been inadequately delivered or adhered to.	Consider inpatient treatment for people with depression who are at significant risk of suicide, self-harm or self-neglect.

Last updated April 2018 consider offering one or more of the following interventions, guided by the person's preference: individual guided self-help based on the principles of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) computerised cognitive behavioural therapy (CCBT) a structured group physical activity programme.	When working with people with depression and their families or carers: provide information appropriate to their level of understanding about the nature of depression and the range of treatments available avoid clinical language without adequate explanation ensure that comprehensive written information is available in the appropriate language and in audio format if possible provide and work proficiently with independent interpreters (that is, someone who is not known to the person with depression) if needed.	Ensure that consent to treatment is based on the provision of clear information (which should also be available in written form) about the intervention, covering: what it comprises what is expected of the person while having it likely outcomes (including any side effects).	For people with recurrent severe depression or depression with psychotic symptoms and for those who have been treated under the Mental Health Act, consider developing advance decisions and advance statements collaboratively with the person	When families or carers are involved in supporting a person with severe or chronic depression, consider: providing written and verbal information on depression and its management, including how families or carers can support the person offering a carer's assessment of their caring, physical and mental health needs if necessary providing information about local family or carer support groups and voluntary organisations, and helping families or carers to access these negotiating between the person and their family or carer about confidentiality and the sharing of information.	When assessing a person who may have depression, conduct a comprehensive assessment that does not rely simply on a symptom count	In addition to assessing symptoms and associated functional impairment, consider how the following factors may have affected the development, course and severity of a person's depression: any history of depression and comorbid mental health or physical disorders any past history of mood elevation (to determine if the depression may be part of bipolar disorder )	When assessing a person with suspected depression, be aware of any learning disabilities or acquired cognitive impairments, and if necessary consider consulting with a relevant specialist when developing treatment plans and strategies.	If there is a risk of self-harm or suicide: assess whether the person has adequate social support and is aware of sources of help arrange help appropriate to the level of risk (see section ) advise the person to seek further help if the situation deteriorates.	Practitioners should consider using competence frameworks developed from the relevant treatment manual(s) and for all interventions should: receive regular high-quality supervision use routine outcome measures and ensure that the person with depression is involved in reviewing the efficacy of the treatment engage in monitoring and evaluation of treatment adherence and practitioner competence – for example, by using video and audio tapes, and external audit and scrutiny where appropriate.	In stepped care the least intrusive, most effective intervention is provided first; if a person does not benefit from the intervention initially offered, or declines an intervention, they should be offered an appropriate intervention from the next step.	Assessment, support, psychoeducation, active monitoring and referral for further assessment and interventions a Complex depression includes depression that shows an inadequate response to multiple treatments, is complicated by psychotic symptoms, and or is associated with significant psychiatric comorbidity or psychosocial factors. b Only for depression where the person also has a chronic physical health problem and associated functional impairment (see depression in adults with a chronic physical health problem: recognition and management NICE clinical guideline 91).	If a person answers 'yes' to either of the depression identification questions (see recommendation ) but the practitioner is not competent to perform a mental health assessment, they should refer the person to an appropriate professional	If a person answers 'yes' to either of the depression identification questions (see recommendation ), a practitioner who is competent to perform a mental health assessment should review the person's mental state and associated functional, interpersonal and social difficulties.	When assessing a person with suspected depression, consider using a validated measure (for example, for symptoms, functions and or disability) to inform and evaluate treatment.	If a person with depression presents considerable immediate risk to themselves or others, refer them urgently to specialist mental health services.	Advise people with depression of the potential for increased agitation, anxiety and suicidal ideation in the initial stages of treatment; actively seek out these symptoms and: ensure that the person knows how to seek help promptly review the person's treatment if they develop marked and or prolonged agitation.	Advise a person with depression and their family or carer to be vigilant for mood changes, negativity and hopelessness, and suicidal ideation, and to contact their practitioner if concerned	If a person with depression is assessed to be at risk of suicide: take into account toxicity in overdose if an antidepressant is prescribed or the person is taking other medication; if necessary, limit the amount of drug(s) available	When the person has an anxiety disorder and comorbid depression or depressive symptoms, consult the NICE guideline for the relevant anxiety disorder (see find guidance) and consider treating the anxiety disorder first (since effective treatment of the anxiety disorder will often improve the depression or the depressive symptoms).	Last updated April 2018 provide information about the nature and course of depression arrange a further assessment, normally within 2 weeks make contact if the person does not attend follow-up appointments.	For people with persistent subthreshold depressive symptoms or mild to moderate depression, consider offering one or more of the following interventions, guided by the person's preference: individual guided self-help based on the principles of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) computerised cognitive behavioural therapy (CCBT) a structured group physical activity programme.	For people with persistent subthreshold depressive symptoms or mild to moderate depression who have not benefited from a low-intensity psychosocial intervention, discuss the relative merits of different interventions with the person and provide: an antidepressant (normally a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor SSRI) or a high-intensity psychological intervention, normally one of the following options:	The choice of intervention should be influenced by the: duration of the episode of depression and the trajectory of symptoms previous course of depression and response to treatment likelihood of adherence to treatment and any potential adverse effects person's treatment preference and priorities.	Discuss antidepressant treatment options with the person with depression, covering: the choice of antidepressant, including any anticipated adverse events, for example side effects and discontinuation symptoms (see recommendation ), and potential interactions with concomitant medication or physical health problems their perception of the efficacy and tolerability of any antidepressants they have previously taken.	For example: the potential for higher doses of venlafaxine to exacerbate cardiac arrhythmias and the need to monitor the person's blood pressure the possible exacerbation of hypertension with venlafaxine and duloxetine the potential for postural hypotension and arrhythmias with TCAs the need for haematological monitoring with mianserin in elderly people.	When prescribing antidepressants, explore any concerns the person with depression has about taking medication, explain fully the reasons for prescribing, and provide information about taking antidepressants, including: the gradual development of the full antidepressant effect the importance of taking medication as prescribed and the need to continue treatment after remission potential side effects the potential for interactions with other medications the risk and nature of discontinuation symptoms with all antidepressants, particularly with drugs with a shorter half-life (such as paroxetine and venlafaxine), and how these symptoms can be minimised the fact that addiction does not occur with antidepressants.	A person with depression started on antidepressants who is considered to present an increased suicide risk or is younger than 30 years (because of the potential increased prevalence of suicidal thoughts in the early stages of antidepressant treatment for this group) should normally be seen after 1 week and frequently thereafter as appropriate until the risk is no longer considered clinically important.	Last updated April 2018 treatment, provide appropriate information and consider one of the following strategies: monitor symptoms closely where side effects are mild and acceptable to the person or stop the antidepressant or change to a different antidepressant if the person prefers or in discussion with the person, consider short-term concomitant treatment with a benzodiazepine if anxiety, agitation and or insomnia are problematic (except in people with chronic symptoms of anxiety); this should usually be for no longer than 2 weeks in order to prevent the development of dependence.	If the person's depression shows no improvement after 2 to 4 weeks with the first antidepressant, check that the drug has been taken regularly and in the prescribed dose.	If response is absent or minimal after 3 to 4 weeks of treatment with a therapeutic dose of an antidepressant, increase the level of support (for example, by weekly face-to-face or telephone contact) and consider: increasing the dose in line with the SPC if there are no significant side effects or switching to another antidepressant as described in section if there are side effects or if the person prefers.	For people with long-standing moderate or severe depression who would benefit from additional social or vocational support, consider: befriending as an adjunct to pharmacological or psychological treatments; befriending should be by trained volunteers providing, typically, at least weekly contact for between 2 and 6 months a rehabilitation programme if a person's depression has resulted in loss of work or disengagement from other social activities over a longer term.	When reviewing drug treatment for a person with depression whose symptoms have not adequately responded to initial pharmacological interventions: check adherence to, and side effects from, initial treatment increase the frequency of appointments using outcome monitoring with a validated	When using combinations of medications (which should only normally be started in primary care in consultation with a consultant psychiatrist): select medications that are known to be safe when used together be aware of the increased side-effect burden this usually causes discuss the rationale for any combination with the person with depression, follow	If a person with depression is informed about, and prepared to tolerate, the increased side-effect burden, consider combining or augmenting an antidepressant with: lithium or an antipsychotic such as aripiprazole , olanzapine , quetiapine or risperidone or another antidepressant such as mirtazapine or mianserin.	For a person whose depression has not responded to either pharmacological or psychological interventions, consider combining antidepressant medication with CBT.	For a person whose depression has failed to respond to various strategies for augmentation and combination treatments, consider referral to a practitioner with a specialist interest in treating depression, or to a specialist service.	Treatment choice should be influenced by: previous treatment history, including the consequences of a relapse, residual symptoms, response to previous treatment and any discontinuation symptoms the person's preference.	Inform the person that they should seek advice from their practitioner if they experience significant discontinuation symptoms	If discontinuation symptoms occur: monitor symptoms and reassure the person if symptoms are mild consider reintroducing the original antidepressant at the dose that was effective (or another antidepressant with a longer half-life from the same class) if symptoms are severe, and reduce the dose gradually while monitoring symptoms.	The assessment of a person with depression referred to specialist mental health services should include: their symptom profile, suicide risk and, where appropriate, previous treatment history	Teams working with people with complex and severe depression should develop comprehensive multidisciplinary care plans in collaboration with the person with depression (and their family or carer, if agreed with the person)	The care plan should: identify clearly the roles and responsibilities of all health and social care professionals involved develop a crisis plan that identifies potential triggers that could lead to a crisis and strategies to manage such triggers be shared with the GP and the person with depression and other relevant people involved in the person's care.	ECT, consider a repeat trial of ECT only after: reviewing the adequacy of the previous treatment course and considering all other options and discussing the risks and benefits with the person and or, where appropriate, their advocate or carer.
