Page 15of 44 pressure is confirmed as being consistently above 140 80 mmHg (or above 130 80 mmHg if there is kidney, eye or cerebrovascular damage). 1.4.5 Add medications if lifestyle advice does not reduce blood pressure to below 140 80 mmHg (below 130 80 mmHg if there is kidney, eye or cerebrovascular damage). 1.4.6 Monitor blood pressure every 1–2 months, and intensify therapy if the person is already on antihypertensive drug treatment, until the blood pressure is consistently below 140 80 mmHg (below 130 80 mmHg if there is kidney, eye or cerebrovascular damage). 1.4.7 First-line antihypertensive drug treatment should be a once-daily, generic angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor.	Caribbean family origin should be an ACE inhibitor plus either a diuretic or ageneric calcium-channel blocker. 1.4.9 A calcium-channel blocker should be the first-line antihypertensive drug treatment for a woman for whom, after an informed discussion, it is agreed there is a possibility of her becoming pregnant. 1.4.10 For a person with continuing intolerance to an ACE inhibitor (other than renal deterioration or hyperkalaemia), substitute an angiotensin II-receptor antagonist for the ACE inhibitor. 1.4.11 Do not combine an ACE inhibitor with an angiotensin II-receptor antagonist to treat hypertension. 1.4.12 If the person's blood pressure is not reduced to the individually agreed target with first-line therapy, add a calcium-channel blocker or a diuretic (usually a thiazide or thiazide-related diuretic).	Add the other drug (that is, thecalcium-channel blocker or diuretic) if the target is not reached with dual therapy 2009, amended 2015.	Page 16of 44 1.4.13 If the person's blood pressure is not reduced to the individually agreed target with triple therapy, add an alpha-blocker, a beta-blocker or a potassium-sparing diuretic (the last with caution if the person is already taking an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin II-receptor antagonist). 1.4.14 Monitor the blood pressure of a person who has attained and consistently remained at his or her blood pressure target every 4–6 months.	Check forpossible adverse effects of antihypertensive drug treatment – including the risks from unnecessarily low blood pressure. 1.5 Antiplatelet therapy 1.5.1 Do not offer antiplatelet therapy (aspirin or clopidogrel) for adults with type 2 diabetes without cardiovascular disease. 1.5.2 For guidance on the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults with type 2 diabetes, see the NICE guidelines on cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction. 1.6 Blood glucose management.	Measurement1.6.1 In adults with type 2 diabetes, measure HbA1c levels at: 3–6-monthly intervals (tailored to individual needs), until the HbA1c is stable on unchanging therapy 6-monthly intervals once the HbA1c level and blood glucose lowering therapy are stable. 1.6.2 Use methods to measure HbA1c that have been calibrated according to.	Rescue therapy at any phase of treatment1.6.18 If an adult with type 2 diabetes is symptomatically hyperglycaemic, consider insulin (see recommendations 1.6.32–1.6.34) or a sulfonylurea, and review treatment when blood glucose control has been achieved..	Algorithm for blood glucose lowering therapy in adults with type 2 diabetes.	First intensification of drug treatment1.6.25 In adults with type 2 diabetes, if initial drug treatment with metformin has not continued to control HbA1c to below the person's individually agreed threshold for intensification, consider dual therapy with: metformin and a DPP-4 inhibitor or metformin and pioglitazone or metformin and a sulfonylurea. 1.6.26 In adults with type 2 diabetes, if metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated and initial drug treatment has not continued to control HbA1c to below the person's individually agreed threshold for intensification, consider dual therapy with: a DPP-4 inhibitor and pioglitazone or a DPP-4 inhibitor and a sulfonylurea or pioglitazone and a sulfonylurea..	Treatment with combinations of medicines including sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2)inhibitors , may be appropriate for some people with type 2 diabetes; see the NICE guidance on canagliflozin in combination therapy for treating type 2 diabetes, dapagliflozin in combination therapy for treating type 2 diabetes and empagliflozin in combination therapy for treating type 2 diabetes..	Second intensification of drug treatment1.6.27 In adults with type 2 diabetes, if dual therapy with metformin and another oral drug (see recommendation 1.6.25) has not continued to control HbA1c to below the person's individually agreed threshold for intensification, consider either: triple therapy with: metformin, a DPP-4 inhibitor and a sulfonylurea or metformin, pioglitazone and a sulfonylurea or starting insulin-based treatment (see recommendations 1.6.32–1.6.34). 1.6.28 If triple therapy with metformin and 2 other oral drugs (see recommendation 1.6.27) is not effective, not tolerated or contraindicated, consider combination therapy with metformin, a sulfonylurea and a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) mimetic for adults with type 2 diabetes who: have a BMI of 35 kg m2 or higher (adjust accordingly for people from black, Asian and other minority ethnic groups) and specific psychological or other medical problems associated with obesity or have a BMI lower than 35 kg m2and: for whom insulin therapy would have significant occupational implications or weight loss would benefit other significant obesity-related comorbidities. 1.6.29 Only continue GLP-1 mimetic therapy if the person with type 2 diabetes has had a beneficial metabolic response (a reduction of at least 11 mmol mol 1.0percent in.	HbA1c and a weight loss of at least 3percent of initial body weight in 6 months).1.6.30 In adults with type 2 diabetes, if metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated, and if dual therapy with 2 oral drugs (see recommendation 1.6.26) has not continued to control HbA1c to below the person's individually agreed threshold for intensification, consider insulin-based treatment (see recommendations 1.6.32–1.6.34)..	Treatment with combinations of medicines including SGLT-2 inhibitors , may be appropriate forsome people with type 2 diabetes; see the NICE guidance on canagliflozin in combination therapy for treating type 2 diabetes, dapagliflozin in combination therapy for treating type 2 diabetes, dapagliflozin in triple therapy for treating type 2 diabetes and empagliflozin in combination therapy for treating type 2 diabetes..	Insulin-based treatments1.6.32 When starting insulin therapy in adults with type 2 diabetes, use a structured programme employing active insulin dose titration that encompasses: injection technique, including rotating injection sites and avoiding repeated injections at the same point within sites continuing telephone support self-monitoring dose titration to target levels dietary understanding.
