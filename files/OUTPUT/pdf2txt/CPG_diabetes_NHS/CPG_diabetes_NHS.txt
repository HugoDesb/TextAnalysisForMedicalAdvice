pioglitazone or a sulfonylurea..
Be aware that, if metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated, repaglinide is both clinicallyeffective and cost effective in adults with type 2 diabetes.
However, discuss with any person forwhom repaglinide is being considered, that there is no licensed non-metformin-based combination containing repaglinide that can be offered at first intensification..
When prescribing pioglitazone, exercise particular caution if the person is at high risk of theadverse effects of the drug.
Pioglitazone is associated with an increased risk of heart failure,bladder cancer and bone fracture.
Known risk factors for these conditions, including increased age,should be carefully evaluated before treatment: see the manufacturers' summaries of product characteristics for details.
Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)guidance (2011) advises that 'prescribers should review the safety and efficacy of pioglitazone in individuals after 3–6 months of treatment to ensure that only patients who are deriving benefit continue to be treated'..

Seek advice from a team with specialist expertise in diabetes orclinical biochemistry..
Targets1.6.5 Involve adults with type 2 diabetes in decisions about their individual HbA1c target.
Encourage them to achieve the target and maintain it unless anyresulting adverse effects (including hypoglycaemia), or their efforts to achieve their target, impair their quality of life. 1.6.6 Offer lifestyle advice and drug treatment to support adults with type 2 diabetes to achieve and maintain their HbA1c target (see section 1.3).
For moreinformation about supporting adherence, see the NICE guideline on medicines adherence. 1.6.7 For adults with type 2 diabetes managed either by lifestyle and diet, or by lifestyle and diet combined with a single drug not associated with hypoglycaemia, support the person to aim for an HbA1c level of 48 mmol/mol (6.5%).
For adults on a drug associated with hypoglycaemia, support the personto aim for an HbA1c level of 53 mmol/mol (7.0%). 1.6.8 In adults with type 2 diabetes, if HbA1c levels are not adequately controlled by a single drug and rise to 58 mmol/mol (7.5%) or higher: reinforce advice about diet, lifestyle and adherence to drug treatment and support the person to aim for an HbA1c level of 53 mmol/mol (7.0%) and intensify drug treatment. 1.6.9 Consider relaxing the target HbA1c level (see recommendations 1.6.7 and 1.6.8).
