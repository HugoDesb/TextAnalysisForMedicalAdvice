The following guidance is based on the best available evidence.
The full guideline gives details ofthe methods and the evidence used to develop the guidance..
The wording used in the recommendations in this guideline (for example words such as 'offer'and 'consider') denotes the certainty with which the recommendation is made (the strength of the recommendation).
See About this guideline for details.1.1 Cardiac rehabilitation after an acute myocardial infarction (MI).
Comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation1.1.1 All patients (regardless of their age) should be given advice about and offered a cardiac rehabilitation programme with an exercise component. 1.1.2 Cardiac rehabilitation programmes should provide a range of options, and patients should be encouraged to attend all those appropriate to their clinical needs.
Patients should not be excluded from the entire programme if theychoose not to attend certain components. 1.1.3 If a patient has cardiac or other clinical conditions that may worsen during exercise, these should be treated if possible before the patient is offered the exercise component of cardiac rehabilitation.
For some patients, the exercisecomponent may be adapted by an appropriately qualified healthcare professional. 1.1.4 Patients with left ventricular dysfunction who are stable can safely be offered the exercise component of cardiac rehabilitation..
Encouraging people to attend1.1.5 Deliver cardiac rehabilitation in a non-judgemental, respectful and culturally sensitive manner.
Consider employing bilingual peer educators or cardiacrehabilitation assistants who reflect the diversity of the local population..

Page 10 of39 1.1.6 Establish people's health beliefs and their specific illness perceptions before offering appropriate lifestyle advice and to encourage attendance to a cardiac rehabilitation programme. 1.1.7 Offer cardiac rehabilitation programmes designed to motivate people to attend and complete the programme.
Explain the benefits of attending.1.1.8 Discuss with the person any factors that might stop them attending a cardiac rehabilitation programme, such as transport difficulties. 1.1.9 Offer cardiac rehabilitation programmes in a choice of venues (including at the person's home, in hospital and in the community) and at a choice of times of day, for example, sessions outside of working hours.
Explain the options available.1.1.10 Provide a range of different types of exercise, as part of the cardiac rehabilitation programme, to meet the needs of people of all ages, or those with significant comorbidity.
Do not exclude people from the whole programme ifthey choose not to attend specific components. 1.1.11 Offer single-sex cardiac rehabilitation programme classes if there is sufficient demand. 1.1.12 Enrol people who have had an MI in a system of structured care, ensuring that there are clear lines of responsibility for arranging the early initiation of cardiac rehabilitation. 1.1.13 Begin cardiac rehabilitation as soon as possible after admission and before discharge from hospital.
Invite the person to a cardiac rehabilitation sessionwhich should start within 10 days of their discharge from hospital. 1.1.14 Contact people who do not start or do not continue to attend the cardiac rehabilitation programme with a further reminder, such as: a motivational letter a prearranged visit from a member of the cardiac rehabilitation team a telephone call.

Offer information and sources of help on:economic issues welfare rights housing and social support issues. 1.1.17 Make cardiac rehabilitation equally accessible and relevant to all people after an.
MI, particularly people from groups that are less likely to access this service..
These include people from black and minority ethnic groups, older people,people from lower socioeconomic groups, women, people from rural communities, people with a learning disability and people with mental and physical health conditions [2007, amended 2013] 1.1.18 Encourage all staff, including senior medical staff, involved in providing care for people after an MI, to actively promote cardiac rehabilitation..
Health education and information needs1.1.19 Comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation programmes should include health education and stress management components. 1.1.20 A home-based programme validated for patients who have had an MI (such as.
The heart manual) that incorporates education, exercise and stressmanagement components with follow-ups by a trained facilitator may be used to provide comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation. 1.1.21 Take into account the physical and psychological status of the patient, the nature of their work and their work environment when giving advice on returning to work..

Regular updates are published on the DVLA website.1.1.23 After an MI without complications, people who wish to travel by air should seek advice from the Civil Aviation Authority.
People who have had a complicated MIneed expert individual advice [2007, amended 2013] 1.1.24 People who have had an MI who hold a pilot's licence should seek advice from the Civil Aviation Authority. 1.1.25 Take into account the patient's physical and psychological status, as well as the type of activity planned when offering advice about the timing of returning to normal activities. 1.1.26 An estimate of the physical demand of a particular activity, and a comparison between activities, can be made using tables of metabolic equivalents (METS) of different activities (for further information please refer to the Centers for.
Disease Control and Prevention website).
Advise patients how to use aperceived exertion scale to help monitor physiological demand.
Patients whohave had a complicated MI may need expert advice. 1.1.27 Advice on competitive sport may need expert assessment of function and risk, and is dependent on what sport is being discussed and the level of competitiveness..
Psychological and social support1.1.28 Offer stress management in the context of comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation. 1.1.29 Do not routinely offer complex psychological interventions such as cognitive behavioural therapy. 1.1.30 Involve partners or carers in the cardiac rehabilitation programme if the patient wishes. 1.1.31 For recommendations on the management of patients with clinical anxiety or depression, refer to Anxiety (NICE clinical guideline 113), Depression in adults.

Sexual activity1.1.32 Reassure patients that after recovery from an MI, sexual activity presents no greater risk of triggering a subsequent MI than if they had never had an MI. 1.1.33 Advise patients who have made an uncomplicated recovery after their MI that they can resume sexual activity when they feel comfortable to do so, usually after about 4 weeks. 1.1.34 Raise the subject of sexual activity with patients within the context of cardiac rehabilitation and aftercare. 1.1.35 When treating erectile dysfunction, treatment with a PDE5 (phosphodiesterase type 5) inhibitor may be considered in men who have had an MI more than 6 months earlier and who are now stable. 1.1.36 PDE5 inhibitors must be avoided in patients treated with nitrates or nicorandil because this can lead to dangerously low blood pressure. 1.2 Lifestyle changes after an MI.
Changing diet1.2.1 Advise people to eat a Mediterranean-style diet (more bread, fruit, vegetables and fish; less meat; and replace butter and cheese with products based on plant oils). 1.2.2 Do not routinely recommend eating oily fish for the sole purpose of preventing another MI.
If people after an MI choose to consume oily fish, be aware thatthere is no evidence of harm, and fish may form part of a Mediterranean-style diet. 1.2.3 Do not offer or advise people to use the following to prevent another MI: omega-3 fatty acid capsules.
