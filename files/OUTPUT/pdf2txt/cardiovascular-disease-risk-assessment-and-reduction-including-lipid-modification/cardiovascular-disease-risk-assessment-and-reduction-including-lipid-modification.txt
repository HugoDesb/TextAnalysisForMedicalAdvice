People have the right to be involved in discussions and make informed decisions about theircare, as described in your care..
Making decisions using NICE guidelines explains how we use words to show the strength (orcertainty) of our recommendations, and has information about professional guidelines, standards and laws (including on consent and mental capacity), and safeguarding. 1.1 Identifying and assessing cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.
Identifying people for full formal risk assessment1.1.1 For the primary prevention of CVD in primary care, use a systematic strategy to identify people who are likely to be at high risk [2008, amended 2014] 1.1.2 Prioritise people on the basis of an estimate of their CVD risk before a full formal risk assessment.
Estimate their CVD risk using CVD risk factors alreadyrecorded in primary care electronic medical records. 1.1.3 People older than 40 should have their estimate of CVD risk reviewed on an ongoing basis. 1.1.4 Prioritise people for a full formal risk assessment if their estimated 10-year risk of CVD is 10% or more [2008, amended 2014] 1.1.5 Discuss the process of risk assessment with the person identified as being at risk, including the option of declining any formal risk assessment. 1.1.6 Do not use opportunistic assessment as the main strategy in primary care to identify CVD risk in unselected people..
Full formal risk assessment1.1.7 Be aware that all CVD risk assessment tools can provide only an approximate value for CVD risk.
Interpretation of CVD risk scores should always reflectinformed clinical judgement..

See recommendations 1.3.23, 1.3.24 and 1.3.25 for advice ontreatment with statins for people with type 1 diabetes. 1.1.10 Use the QRISK2 risk assessment tool to assess CVD risk in people with type 2 diabetes. 1.1.11 Do not use a risk assessment tool to assess CVD risk in people with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 and/or albuminuria.
These people are at increased risk of CVD.
See recommendation1.3.27 for advice on treatment with statins for people with chronic kidney disease (CKD). 1.1.12 Complete as many fields of the risk assessment tool as possible. 1.1.13 Routinely record ethnicity, body mass index and family history of premature.
CVD in medical records.1.1.14 Consider socioeconomic status as an additional factor that contributes to CVD risk. 1.1.15 Do not use a risk assessment tool for people with pre-existing CVD [2008, amended 2014] 1.1.16 Do not use a risk assessment tool for people who are at high risk of developing.
CVD because of familial hypercholesterolaemia (see familialhypercholesterolaemia [NICE guideline CG71]) or other inherited disorders of lipid metabolism [2008, amended 2014] 1.1.17 When using the risk score to inform drug treatment decisions, particularly if it is near to the threshold for treatment, take into account other factors that: may predispose the person to premature CVD and may not be included in calculated risk scores [2008, amended 2014].

These groups include:people treated for HIV people with serious mental health problems people taking medicines that can cause dyslipidaemia such as antipsychotic medication, corticosteroids or immunosuppressant drugs people with autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus, and other systemic inflammatory disorders [2008, amended 2014] 1.1.19 Recognise that CVD risk will be underestimated in people who are already taking antihypertensive or lipid modification therapy, or who have recently stopped smoking.
Use clinical judgement to decide on further treatment of riskfactors in people who are below the CVD risk threshold for treatment [2008, amended 2014] 1.1.20 Severe obesity (body mass index greater than 40 kg/m2) increases CVD risk..
Take this into account when using risk scores to inform treatment decisions inthis group (see the NICE guideline on obesity: identification, assessment and management). 1.1.21 Consider people aged 85 or older to be at increased risk of CVD because of age alone, particularly people who smoke or have raised blood pressure [2008, amended 2014].
Communication about risk assessment and treatment1.1.22 NICE has produced guidance on the components of good patient experience in adult NHS services.
These include recommendations on the communication ofrisk.
Follow the recommendations in patient experience in adult NHS services(NICE guidance CG138). 1.1.23 Use everyday, jargon-free language to communicate information on risk.
Iftechnical terms are used, explain them clearly..

CVD1.3.1 Be aware that when deciding on lipid modification therapy for the prevention of.
CVD, drugs are preferred for which there is evidence in clinical trials of abeneficial effect on CVD morbidity and mortality. 1.3.2 When a decision is made to prescribe a statin use a statin of high intensity and low acquisition cost..
Lipid measurement and referral1.3.3 Measure both total and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol to achieve the best estimate of CVD risk. 1.3.4 Before starting lipid modification therapy for the primary prevention of CVD, take at least 1 lipid sample to measure a full lipid profile.
This should includemeasurement of total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations.
A fasting sample is not needed..
For information about implementing this recommendation, see implementation:getting started. 1.3.5 Use the clinical findings, lipid profile and family history to judge the likelihood of a familial lipid disorder rather than the use of strict lipid cut-off values alone. 1.3.6 Exclude possible common secondary causes of dyslipidaemia (such as excess alcohol, uncontrolled diabetes, hypothyroidism, liver disease and nephrotic syndrome) before referring for specialist review. 1.3.7 Consider the possibility of familial hypercholesterolaemia and investigate as described in familial hypercholesterolaemia (NICE guideline CG71) if they have: a total cholesterol concentration more than 7.5 mmol/litre and a family history of premature coronary heart disease. 1.3.8 Arrange for specialist assessment of people with a total cholesterol concentration of more than 9.0 mmol/litre or a non-HDL cholesterol.

Page 26 of44 2 Implementation: getting started.
This section highlights some important changes to practice that may result from implementing thisguideline identified at publication in July 2014.
With input from stakeholders, experts and healthprofessionals, 3 areas have been identified that may have a big impact on practice or could be challenging to implement.
However, other changes to practice may be needed to fully implementthe guideline. 2.1 Measuring non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol when lipid profiling for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease.
See recommendation 1.3.4..
Potential impact of implementation.
Non-high density lipoprotein (non-HDL) cholesterol is seen to be a better cardiovascular disease(CVD) risk indicator than low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol.
It is more accurate, morepractical and cost effective.
A fasting blood sample is not needed.
This is more convenient forpatients and may reduce the need for additional blood samples.
Those requesting lipid profiles fortheir patients – such as GPs, practice nurses and community pharmacists – may need to change their practice.
Laboratories may also need to change their reporting procedures..
Challenges for implementation.
The United Kingdom National External Quality Assessment Service (UKNEQAS) estimatedthat less than 10% of laboratories included non-HDL cholesterol in their reports; however, this was primarily due to lack of demand..
Healthcare workers may need educating in what the non-HDL cholesterol test means, how tointerpret the laboratory results, and how it compares with the previously used LDL cholesterol test..
Support for implementation.
The Association of Clinical Biochemistry and Laboratory Me
