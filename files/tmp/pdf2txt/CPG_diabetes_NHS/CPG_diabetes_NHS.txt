Your responsibility.
The recommendations in this guideline represent the view of NICE, arrived at after carefulconsideration of the evidence available.
When exercising their judgement, professionals andpractitioners are expected to take this guideline fully into account, alongside the individual needs, preferences and values of their patients or the people using their service.
It is not mandatory toapply the recommendations, and the guideline does not override the responsibility to make decisions appropriate to the circumstances of the individual, in consultation with them and their families and carers or guardian..
Local commissioners and providers of healthcare have a responsibility to enable the guideline to beapplied when individual professionals and people using services wish to use it.
They should do so inthe context of local and national priorities for funding and developing services, and in light of their duties to have due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful discrimination, to advance equality of opportunity and to reduce health inequalities.
Nothing in this guideline should be interpreted in away that would be inconsistent with complying with those duties..
Commissioners and providers have a responsibility to promote an environmentally sustainablehealth and care system and should assess and reduce the environmental impact of implementing.
NICE recommendations wherever possible..

This guidance updates and replaces 'Type 2 diabetes' (NICE guideline CG87).
Therecommendations are labelled according to when they were originally published (see update information for details)..
Type 2 diabetes is a chronic metabolic condition characterised by insulin resistance (that is, thebody's inability to effectively use insulin) and insufficient pancreatic insulin production, resulting in high blood glucose levels (hyperglycaemia).
Type 2 diabetes is commonly associated with obesity,physical inactivity, raised blood pressure, disturbed blood lipid levels and a tendency to develop thrombosis, and therefore is recognised to have an increased cardiovascular risk.
It is associatedwith long-term microvascular and macrovascular complications, together with reduced quality of life and life expectancy..
In 2013, over 3.2 million adults were diagnosed with diabetes, with prevalence rates of 6% and6.7% in England and Wales respectively.
It is estimated that about 90% of adults currentlydiagnosed with diabetes have type 2 diabetes.
Type 2 diabetes is more common in people of.
African, African-Caribbean and South Asian family origin.
It can occur in all age groups and isincreasingly being diagnosed in children..
Multiple vascular risk factors and wide-ranging complications make diabetes care complex andtime-consuming, and many areas of healthcare services must be involved for optimal management..
Necessary lifestyle changes, the complexities and possible side effects of therapy make patienteducation and self-management important aspects of diabetes care.
Diabetes care is estimated toaccount for at least 5% of UK healthcare expenditure, and up to 10% of NHS expenditure..
This guideline contains recommendations for managing type 2 diabetes in adults, and focuses onpatient education, dietary advice, managing cardiovascular risk, managing blood glucose levels, and identifying and managing long-term complications.
The guideline does not cover diagnosis,secondary diabetes, type 1 diabetes in adults, diabetes in pregnancy and diabetes in children and young people..
Reasons for the update.
Since the publication of the 2009 guideline, availability of new evidence and several keydevelopments have prompted an update in the following areas: managing blood glucose levels, antiplatelet therapy and erectile dysfunction.
In particular, reasons included safety concernssurrounding some blood glucose lowering medicines, new evidence on new dipeptidyl peptidase-4.

In addition, new evidence and safety issues relating to theoff-label use of antiplatelet therapy (aspirin and clopidogrel) in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease motivated an update of this review..
The guideline will assume that prescribers will use a medicine's summary of product characteristicsto inform decisions made with individual patients..
This guideline recommends some medicines for indications for which they do not have a UKmarketing authorisation at the date of publication, if there is good evidence to support that use..
The prescriber should follow relevant professional guidance, taking full responsibility for thedecision.
The patient (or those with authority to give consent on their behalf) should provideinformed consent, which should be documented.
See the General Medical Council's Prescribingguidance: prescribing unlicensed medicines for further information.
Where recommendations havebeen made for the use of medicines outside their licensed indications ('off-label use'), these medicines are marked with a footnote in the recommendations..

Patient-centred care.
This guideline offers best practice advice on the care of adults with type 2 diabetes..
When caring for older adults with type 2 diabetes, particular consideration should be given to theirbroader health and social care needs.
Older people are more likely to have co-existing conditionsand to be on a greater number of medicines.
Their ability to benefit from risk-reductioninterventions in the longer term may also be reduced..
Much of the evidence base used to inform this guideline has been generated from studies involvingyounger adults (study mean ages ranged from 45 to 68 years).
While the Guideline Development.
Group thought that the recommendations are applicable to a wider age group, they highlightedthat there needs to be flexibility, to ensure that the care of older people with diabetes also addresses their broader health and social care needs..
Patients and healthcare professionals have rights and responsibilities as set out in the NHS.
Constitution for England – all NICE guidance is written to reflect these.
Treatment and care shouldtake into account individual needs and preferences.
Patients should have the opportunity to makeinformed decisions about their care and treatment, in partnership with their healthcare professionals.
If the patient is under 16, their family or carers should also be given information andsupport to help the child or young person to make decisions about their treatment.
If it is clear thatthe child or young person fully understands the treatment and does not want their family or carers to be involved, they can give their own consent.
Healthcare professionals should follow the.
Department of Health's advice on consent.
If someone does not have capacity to make decisions,healthcare professionals should follow the code of practice that accompanies the Mental Capacity.
Act and the supplementary code of practice on deprivation of liberty safeguards..
NICE has produced guidance on the components of good patient experience in adult NHS services..
All healthcare professionals should follow the recommendations in patient experience in adult NHSservices..

Key priorities for implementation.
The following recommendations have been identified as priorities for implementation.
The full listof recommendations is in section 1..
Patient education.
Offer structured education to adults with type 2 diabetes and/or their family members orcarers (as appropriate) at and around the time of diagnosis, with annual reinforcement and review.
Explain to people and their carers that structured education is an integral part ofdiabetes care [2009].
Ensure that any structured education programme for adults with type 2 diabetes includes thefollowing components:.
It is evidence-based, and suits the needs of the person..
It has specific aims and learning objectives, and supports the person and their familymembers and carers in developing attitudes, beliefs, knowledge and skills to self-manage diabetes..
It has a structured curriculum that is theory-driven, evidence-based andresource-effective, has supporting materials, and is written down..
It is delivered by trained educators who have an understanding of educational theoryappropriate to the age and needs of the person, and who are trained and competent to deliver the principles and content of the programme..
It is quality assured, and reviewed by trained, competent, independent assessors whomeasure it against criteria that ensure consistency..
The outcomes are audited regularly[2015].
Dietary advice.
Integrate dietary advice with a personalised diabetes management plan, including otheraspects of lifestyle modification, such as increasing physical activity and losing weight [2009].
Blood pressure management.
Add medications if lifestyle advice does not reduce blood pressure to below 140/80 mmHg.

Page 9 of44 (below 130/80 mmHg if there is kidney, eye or cerebrovascular damage) [2009].
Monitor blood pressure every 1–2 months, and intensify therapy if the person is already onantihypertensive drug treatment, until the blood pressure is consistently below 140/80 mmHg (below 130/80 mmHg if there is kidney, eye or cerebrovascular damage) [2009].
Blood glucose management.
Involve adults with type 2 diabetes in decisions about their individual HbA1c target.
Encouragethem to achieve the target and maintain it unless any resulting adverse effects (including hypoglycaemia), or their efforts to achieve their target, impair their quality of life [new 2015].
In adults with type 2 diabetes, if HbA1c levels are not adequately controlled by a single drugand rise to 58 mmol/mol (7.5%) or higher: reinforce advice about diet, lifestyle and adherence to drug treatment and support the person to aim for an HbA1c level of 53 mmol/mol (7.0%) and intensify drug treatment [new 2015].
Do not routinely offer self-monitoring of blood glucose levels for adults with type 2 diabetesunless: the person is on insulin or there is evidence of hypoglycaemic episodes or the person is on oral medication that may increase their risk of hypoglycaemia while driving or operating machinery or the person is pregnant, or is planning to become pregnant.
For more information, seethe NICE guideline on diabetes in pregnancy [new 2015].
Drug treatment.
Offer standard-release metformin as the initial drug treatment for adults with type 2 diabetes.[new 2015].
In adults with type 2 diabetes, if metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated, consider initialdrug treatment[1] with: a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor or.

Page 10of 44 pioglitazone[2]or a sulfonylurea [new 2015] [1] Be aware that, if metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated, repaglinide is both clinically effective and cost effective in adults with type 2 diabetes.
However, discuss with any person forwhom repaglinide is being considered, that there is no licensed non-metformin-based combination containing repaglinide that can be offered at first intensification. [2] When prescribing pioglitazone, exercise particular caution if the person is at high risk of the adverse effects of the drug.
Pioglitazone is associated with an increased risk of heart failure,bladder cancer and bone fracture.
Known risk factors for these conditions, including increased age,should be carefully evaluated before treatment: see the manufacturers' summaries of product characteristics for details.
Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)guidance (2011) advises that 'prescribers should review the safety and efficacy of pioglitazone in individuals after 3–6 months of treatment to ensure that only patients who are deriving benefit continue to be treated'..

In several cases, blood glucose levelswere only moderately elevated.
The MHRA advised that healthcare professionals should test forraised ketones in people with ketoacidosis symptoms who are receiving an SGLT-2 inhibitor, even if their plasma glucose levels are near-normal.

It advises that if thecombination is used, people should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain, and oedema.
Pioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac status occurs.[10] The recommendations in this guideline also apply to any current and future biosimilar product(s) of insulin glargine that have an appropriate marketing authorisation that allows the use of the biosimilar(s) in the same indication. [11] Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) guidance (2014) notes that domperidone is associated with a small increased risk of serious cardiac side effects.
Domperidoneis now contraindicated in certain groups in whom the risk of cardiac effects is higher; its marketing authorisations have also been restricted to its use in the relief of nausea and vomiting only, at the lowest effective dose and for the shortest possible time (usually not more than 1 week): see the.
MHRA guidance and summaries of product characteristics.
The MHRA advises that prescribersshould take into account the overall safety profile of domperidone, and in particular its cardiac risk and potential interactions with other medicines (such as erythromycin), if there is a clinical need to use it at doses or durations greater than those authorised.

Page 33of 44 2 Research recommendations.
The Guideline Development Group has made the following recommendations for research, basedon its review of evidence, to improve NICE guidance and patient care in the future.
The Guideline.
Development Group's full set of research recommendations is detailed in the full guideline.2.1 The effects of stopping and/or switching drug treatments to control blood glucose levels.
In adults with type 2 diabetes, what are the effects of stopping and/or switching drug treatments tocontrol blood glucose levels, and what criteria should inform the decision?.
Why this is important.
There is a lack of evidence on the effects of stopping and/or switching drug treatments to controlblood glucose levels.
The current practice of 'stopping rules' is typically motivated by eitherinadequate blood glucose control (rising HbA1c levels) or intolerable side effects.
There is limitedunderstanding of the short- and long-term effects of stopping a therapy and switching to another in terms of diabetes control (HbA1c levels), hypoglycaemic risk, weight gain, and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.
In addition, there is limited understanding of how quickly considerationshould be given to stopping and switching to another drug treatment and, if stopping and switching may be needed, what the optimal sequencing is of drug treatments.
Randomised controlled trialsexamining these different issues would help to improve diabetes care. 2.2 Non-metformin-based drug treatment combinations to control blood glucose levels.
In adults with type 2 diabetes, what treatment combinations (for example, glucagon-like peptide-1[GLP-1] mimetics and insulin combination therapy with meglitinides) are most effective when initial drug treatment with non-metformin monotherapy fails to adequately control blood glucose levels?.
Why this is important.
Although it is recognised that metformin therapy is suitable for most adults with type 2 diabetes, itsuse is contraindicated or not tolerated in approximately 15% of individuals.
To date, researchevidence has largely focused on metformin-based treatment combinations.
Given the progressivenature of the condition, in which intensification of blood glucose lowering drug therapies are indicated over time, there is little evidence, for some adults, to guide management strategies on.

Page 34of 44 treatment combinations that do not include metformin.
Randomised controlled trials are thereforeneeded to better understand the treatment choices that are available which improve blood glucose control and long-term risks of complications associated with diabetes. 2.3 Drug treatment (third intensification) for when blood glucose levels are inadequately controlled by 3 oral antidiabetic drugs and/or insulin combinations.
When third intensification of treatment is indicated, which blood glucose lowering therapies shouldbe used to control blood glucose levels?.
Why this is important.
As the incidence of type 2 diabetes increases in the younger population and as blood glucosecontrol declines naturally over time, it is likely that further intensification of therapies would be needed.
Currently, there is evidence up to second intensification of drug therapies, that is, when2 or more non-insulin-based treatment combinations fail to adequately control blood glucose levels.
Randomised controlled trials are needed to improve understanding of alternative treatmentoptions for adults at second intensification whose blood glucose is inadequately controlled with insulin and/or triple non-insulin-based drug therapies. 2.4 Long-term outcomes associated with blood glucose lowering agents.
In adults with type 2 diabetes, what are the long-term effects of blood glucose lowering therapiessuch as dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors and meglitinides?.
Why this is important.
There is limited evidence in relation to the long-term effects (at least 5 years) of blood glucoselowering therapies, particularly newer agents in terms of efficacy and adverse events (for example, cardiovascular outcomes).
Randomised controlled trials and prospective longitudinal studies areneeded to better understand the long-term efficacy and safety issues surrounding these medicines. 2.5 Self-monitoring of blood glucose levels.
What is the optimal frequency for self-monitoring of blood glucose in adults with type 2 diabetes?.

Why this is important.
It is widely recognised that self-monitoring of blood glucose is a multicomponent intervention.
Aswell as being educated about how to use a self-monitoring device to assess blood glucose levels, adults with type 2 diabetes need to be able to understand their results and act on the observed readings..
In adults for whom self-monitoring is appropriate, there is limited evidence to guide clinicalpractice in prescribing self-monitoring regimens, in terms of frequency of testing and optimal blood glucose targets.
Given the inconvenience and expense of self-monitoring, robust evidence fromrandomised controlled trials is needed to guide the optimal use of this intervention..

The algorithm for blood glucose lowering therapy in adults with type 2diabetes was also updated to revise footnote b with links to relevant NICE guidance on SGLT-2 inhibitors, and new information on SGLT-2 inhibitors was also added to the box on action to take if metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated..
December 2016: The text following recommendation 1.6.31 and the algorithm for blood glucoselowering therapy in adults with type 2 diabetes were updated to include reference to NICE TA418 on dapagliflozin in triple therapy for treating type 2 diabetes..
July 2016: Recommendation 1.7.17 has been reworded to clarify the role of GPs in referring peoplefor eye screening and also to add information on when this should happen..
December 2015: This guidance updates and replaces NICE guideline CG87 (published May 2009)..
It also updates and replaces NICE technology appraisal guidance 203 and NICE technologyappraisal guidance 248..
It has not been possible to update all recommendations in this update of the guideline.
Areas forreview and update were identified and prioritised through the scoping process and stakeholder feedback.
Areas that have not been reviewed in this update may be addressed in 2 years' time when.
NICE next considers updating this guideline.
NICE is currently considering setting up a standingupdate committee for diabetes, which would enable more rapid update of discrete areas of the diabetes guidelines, as and when new and relevant evidence is published..
